       "{datetime.datetime(2022, 10, 31, 0, 0): ['In this article TSLA\\n\\nTWTR Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\n\\nThe Twitter profile page belonging to Elon Musk is seen on an Apple iPhone mobile phone. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\\n\\nNew Twitter owner Elon Musk has pulled more than 50 of his trusted Tesla employees, mostly software engineers from the Autopilot team, into his Twitter takeover, CNBC has learned. Musk, who is CEO of automaker Tesla and reusable rocket maker SpaceX, completed the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter on Oct. 28 and made his mark there immediately. He fired the company\\'s CEO, chief financial officer, policy and legal team leaders right away, and has also dissolved Twitter\\'s board of directors. According to internal records viewed by CNBC, employees from Musk\\'s other companies are now authorized to work at Twitter, including more than 50 from Tesla, two from the Boring Company (which is building underground tunnels) and one from Neuralink (which is developing a brain-computer interface). Some of Musk\\'s friends, advisors and backers, including the head of his family office Jared Birchall, angel investor Jason Calacanis, and founding PayPal chief operating officer and venture capitalist David Sacks, are also involved. So are two people who share Musk\\'s last name, James and Andrew Musk, who have worked at Palantir and Neuralink, respectively.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nAmong the dozens who Elon Musk enlisted specifically from Tesla are: director of software development Ashok Elluswamy, director of Autopilot and TeslaBot engineering Milan Kovac, senior director of software engineering Maha Virduhagiri; Pete Scheutzow, a senior staff technical program manager, and Jake Nocon, who is part of Tesla\\'s surveillance unit, as a senior manager of security intelligence. Nocon previously worked for Uber and Nisos, a security company that had a multimillion-dollar contract with Tesla to identify insider threats, and monitor critics of the company. At Twitter, Musk is counting on his lieutenants and loyalists to decide who and what to cut or keep at the social network. He is also pressing them to learn everything they can about Twitter as quickly as possible, from source code to content moderation and data-privacy requirements, so he can redesign the platform, several Twitter employees told CNBC over the weekend.\\n\\nMusk has billed himself as a free speech absolutist, but he has to balance those wishes with laws and business realities. He said in an open letter to advertisers last week as he was taking over the company: \"Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences.\" It is not immediately clear how Tesla employees are expected to split their schedules between the automaker and Twitter. Typically, when Tesla employees work for other Elon Musk ventures, usually SpaceX or the Boring Company, they can get paid by the other venture as a consultant. Some of Musk\\'s employees have full-time roles at more than one of his businesses. For example, Tesla Vice President of Materials Charlie Kuehmann, is concurrently a vice president at SpaceX. At other times, two Tesla employees told CNBC, workers at the electric automaker are pressured to help with projects at his other companies for no additional pay because it\\'s seen as good for their careers, or because the work is regarded as helping with a related party transaction or project. Tesla is facing serious scrutiny around the technology built and maintained by its Autopilot team, namely its driver-assistance systems, which are marketed as Autopilot, FSD and FSD Beta. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles are all investigating whether Tesla or Musk violated laws and misled consumers about Tesla\\'s driver assistance systems, which are still in development and do not make the company\\'s cars self-driving. Meanwhile, the federal vehicle safety authority, NHTSA, continues to investigate whether Tesla driver assistance systems may have contained defects that contributed to or caused collisions. The way that Tesla marketed these systems on social media, including Twitter, is part of the scope of at least one NHTSA investigation.\\n\\nCode reviews and 12-hour shifts\\n\\nSeveral Twitter employees told CNBC over the weekend that Tesla employees now at Twitter have been involved in code review at the social network, even though their skills from working on Autopilot and other Tesla software and hardware do not directly overlap with the languages and systems used to build and maintain the social network. These employees asked not to be named because they\\'re not authorized to talk to the press about internal matters, and feared retaliation. For example, most engineers in automotive companies, even the tech-forward Tesla, do not have experience designing and operating search engines and platforms that are broadly accessible to the public. Twitter has multiple code bases with millions of lines of code in each, and myriad 10 million or even 100 million or more queries per second (QPS) systems underpinning it. At Tesla, Python is one of the preferred scripting languages, and at Twitter programmers have used Scala extensively. Twitter also has more exposure to international regulations around hate speech and data privacy, for example, particularly the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation. Twitter employees who were there before Musk took over said they have been asked to show his teams all manner of technical documentation, to justify their work and their teams\\' work, and to explain their value within the company. The threat of dismissal looms if they do not impress, they said. The employees said they are worried about being fired without cause or warning, rather than laid off with severance. Some are worried that they will not be able to reap the rewards of stock options that are scheduled to vest in the first week of November, according to documentation viewed by CNBC. Meanwhile, the Twitter employees said they have not received specific plans from Musk and his team yet, and are largely in the dark about possible head count cuts within their groups, budgets and long-term strategies. Musk has set nearly impossible deadlines for some to do-list items, however. One immediate project is to redesign the company\\'s subscription software, dubbed Twitter Blue, and the company\\'s verification system (known sometimes as \"blue checks\" for the way they are denoted on the service). Employees say Musk wants that work done by the first week of November. The Verge previously reported that Musk wants to charge $20 per user per month, and to only give verification marks to the accounts of users who are paid subscribers, and would remove verification from accounts who do not pay for Twitter Blue.\\n\\nwatch now'],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2022, 12, 23, 0, 0): ['The last straw for Heather was Elon Musk\\'s attacks on Anthony Fauci, one of the world\\'s most respected immunologists and the outgoing director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. For Logan, it was when Musk ordered employees to stop paying Twitter\\'s bills to vendors for services they\\'d already rendered.\\n\\nFor Tom, Musk\\'s corrosive and unstable leadership of Twitter since he bought the social media site at the end of October was just too much.\\n\\nAnd when each of them called to cancel their Tesla car preorders or to terminate their car leases over the past few months, saying Musk\\'s toxic behavior was the reason, each heard pretty much the same thing from the Tesla salesperson on the other end of the line: \"We\\'re hearing a lot of that.\"\\n\\nFor the past two months, Musk, 51, has been managing Twitter as its new owner and CEO, after paying $44 billion to buy the company. Now it seems the toll of his chaotic leadership style, while also increasingly splitting his time, is wearing on his other companies. The world\\'s second-richest person is also CEO of electric car manufacturer Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Musk initiated a poll asking users whether he should step down as CEO of Twitter. When voting closed 12 hours later, 57% of 17.5 million accounts tallied said he should go. Musk responded that he plans to resign as CEO \"as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!\" He added, though, that he plans to stick around, overseeing the software and servers teams. As Twitter\\'s primary owner, he\\'ll also likely have an outsized say in how the company\\'s run.\\n\\nAfter paying $44 billion to buy Twitter, Elon Musk asked users whether he should step down as its leader. Twitter\\n\\nIf Musk\\'s tenure as CEO may be drawing to an end, it comes after his work over the past couple months was punctuated by his outspoken embrace of extremist right-wing reactionaries, his attacks on former staff from marginalized communities, his spreading of homophobic lies about an attack on the husband of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and his haphazard pronouncements of new policies at one of the world\\'s most influential communications platforms.\\n\\nTwitter is no longer a publicly traded company, but Tesla is. And investors there are not happy.\\n\\nTesla\\'s shares have plummeted more than 44% since the deal was finalized Oct. 27, with Musk reportedly pulling engineers from projects at the carmaker to help keep Twitter running after he unceremoniously fired half of Twitter\\'s employees a week into his takeover. Some big name advertisers, who account for nearly 90% of Twitter\\'s sales, have bailed. Those who\\'ve spoken publicly say his corrosive behavior, in addition to poorly planned changes to the site that led to a proliferation of fake accounts, are too much. (Musk has separately blamed unnamed \"activists\" for pressuring companies to cut back spending.)\\n\\nThis week, analysts began warning investors of the toll it was all taking. On Monday, Oppenheimer was among the first major analyst firms to issue a downgrade for Tesla\\'s stock, CNBC reported, rating it at \"perform\" from \"outperform\" before. On Tuesday, Evercore ISI slashed its 12-month price target for Tesla stock by a third, cutting it to $200 from $300. Analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets reportedly marked their target even lower, at $177, citing a \"higher risk profile from the Twitter distraction.\"\\n\\nTesla\\'s stock has sunk more than 19% just this week, even though Musk on Thursday said during a public interview that he hadn\\'t missed \"a single important Tesla meeting\" since taking over as Twitter CEO. Still, he promised to spend more time working at Tesla again, saying the car maker was \"a far more complex beast\" to manage.\\n\\nAt the same time, Tesla has made increasingly aggressive offers to convince would-be customers to jump in. Tesla offered at least one customer a nearly $4,000 credit by phone. In early December, the company added a note to its website offering $3,750 and 10,000 free Supercharging miles to people willing to take delivery of a new Model 3 sedan or Model Y crossover cars by the end of the year. On Wednesday, the company bumped that offer up to $7,500.\\n\\nMusk has sold nearly $40 billion worth of his Tesla shares to help fund Twitter, even as an estimated $1.2 billion interest payment comes due over the next year. The South African entrepreneur\\'s personal fortune has dropped by about half, to $140 billion, according to Bloomberg\\'s Billionaires Index, which tracks real-time net worth of the world\\'s richest people.\\n\\nElon Musk became the world\\'s richest human primarily through his work at Tesla. Screenshot by CNET\\n\\nAnd the man who loves to create memes and hashtags has become the subject of many, with detractors calling him out with #ElonTheSnowflake, #ElonIsDestroyingTwitter and #ElonMuskIsaGiantTurd. Last week, the Twittersphere dubbed him \"Space Karen\" for pulling the plug on a Twitter\\'s Spaces discussion after he failed to answer questions by some of the journalists who he\\'d banned temporarily from the site after they wrote stories about him he didn\\'t like.\\n\\n\"His personality is absolutely tanking the Tesla brand,\" said Heather, a biotech executive who\\'s nearing the end of her lease for an extended-range Model S. \"I\\'m looking forward to having an Elon-free existence.\"\\n\\nHeather and other Tesla owners have increasingly been telling family, friends and posting on social media that they no longer want to be associated with him. More than a dozen accounts have tweeted seeming cancellations for Tesla cars in response to the billionaire\\'s tweets, often to mocking responses from Musk defenders.\\n\\nThree customers whose lease payments were finishing or were about to take delivery on a car spoke with CNET on the condition of anonymity because they worried that they might be harassed online and, potentially, in real life by the online mobs that endorse Musk and are now emboldened to say whatever they want on his platform. CNET gave them pseudonyms for this story and in one case changed the gender of a Tesla customer because they were so concerned about the possible backlash. They have good reason to be worried.\\n\\nYoel Roth, Twitter\\'s former head of trust and safety, and his family were forced to flee their home for fear of their physical safety, the Washington Post reported, after Musk attacked him in a series of tweets. Musk misrepresented Roth\\'s academic writing about sexuality and children, which led to a flood of harassment and threats toward the Twitter executive, his family and professors who reviewed his earlier work. (Roth resigned from Twitter after Musk declared himself \"chief twit,\" making clear he\\'d be calling the shots rather than deferring to trust and safety teams focused on \"principled development.\")\\n\\nUltimately, those online mobs, have added complexity to the swirl of emotions people have around Twitter, Musk and Tesla. For example, Logan, a Tesla Model 3 lessee from southern California who works in real estate services, was drawn to Tesla and its battery-powered cars because he didn\\'t want to support oil companies and also because he really liked the car. \"It\\'s comfortable and it drives great.\"\\n\\n\"His personality is absolutely tanking the Tesla brand.\" Heather, Model S owner\\n\\nBut Musk\\'s behavior since taking over Twitter, including his short-lived defense of rapper Kanye West\\'s antisemitic comments disparaging Jews and praising Nazi leader Adolph Hitler, was too much.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to support a company or anyone who acts that way,\" Logan said.\\n\\nTom, a former Tesla investor who owned a car and had put down a deposit with SpaceX\\'s Starlink satellite internet service, said he\\'s walking away from endeavors by Musk\\'s companies altogether.\\n\\nOnce impressed with Musk and his businesses, Tom now says of Musk that he\\'s \"the worst troll in my feed.\"\\n\\n\"If he wants to be CEO of social media company, he should really focus on that and let this other company go,\" Tom added. \"If he stepped down from Tesla, I would definitely reconsider keeping the car.\"\\n\\nElon Musk carried a sink when he arrived at Twitter\\'s San Francisco headquarters the day before his takeover. His accompanying tweet said, \"Let that sink in.\" Elon Musk / Getty Images\\n\\nCall and response\\n\\n\\n\\nThese Tesla owners aren\\'t alone. A poll by YouGov found that opinions about Tesla among car buyers have radically shifted in the past two months. The company had a net-positive score of 5.9% at the beginning of this year, peaking at 6.7% in May. But in November, it fell to a negative 1.4% reading last month, The Wall Street Journal reported, and that was before Musk tweeted his attack on Fauci. Morning Consult found more people hold a similarly negative view of Tesla than at the start of the year.\\n\\nTesla is still the most widely used electric car brand in the US, according to S&P Global Mobility, which tracks automotive industry data. Two years ago, it represented 79% of electric vehicles registered in the US. But that number\\'s dropped to 65% so far this year, as major competitors including GM, Ford, Hyundai and Toyota expand their EV offerings. By 2025, S&P Global Mobility expects Tesla\\'s share of the EV market to plummet to below 20%.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to support a company or anyone who acts that way.\" Logan, Model 3 owner\\n\\nFor his part, Musk in October told analysts on a financial earnings conference call that he tracked \"excellent demand\" for the holiday shopping season. He said he expected to \"sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see.\" Those comments were made a week before he took over as Twitter\\'s CEO.\\n\\nBut Tesla sales staff suggest a different story. When Logan called to cancel his order on a new car at the end of his lease early next year, Tesla staff offered him nearly $4,000 to keep the order. The company\\'s entry-level Model 3 starts at $46,990, not including tax incentives and other savings. Prices go up to more than $162,940 for a Model X SUV.\\n\\nTesla appended a note to its website in early December with an offer, similar to Logan\\'s, of $3,750 off the sticker price and 10,000 miles of free Supercharging to anyone willing to take delivery of before the end of the year. On Wednesday, the company increased its offer up to $7,500.\\n\\nElon Musk has said he wants to allow people to post all tweets that don\\'t break the law. Twitter\\n\\nHeather, the biotech executive who\\'s a fan of muscle cars, said she got a call from Tesla around the time Musk took over Twitter, asking if she planned to keep her lease on her Model S or trade it in. When she said Musk\\'s behavior had turned her away, the staff tried to distance themselves from their CEO, saying he doesn\\'t represent the whole company.\\n\\nWhen sales staff called again, Heather told them it\\'s only gotten worse. Once a regular Twitter user, Heather\\'s decided to move to competing social network Post. \"I don\\'t know what\\'s happened to him,\" she said, asking why the Tesla\\'s board of directors is allowing his behavior.\\n\\nTesla, which doesn\\'t have a PR department, didn\\'t respond to a request for comment, nor did its board of directors. Twitter, which also no longer appears to have a PR team, didn\\'t respond to request for comment. Musk, who tweets many times each day, didn\\'t respond to requests for comment either.\\n\\nMusk has said if he can\\'t turn Twitter around, it may need to declare bankruptcy. James Martin/CNET\\n\\nGetting out\\n\\nTesla owners aren\\'t the only people upset about Musk\\'s behavior. A chorus of analysts and investors on Wall Street have been raising alarms since Musk announced his plans to take over Twitter last April.\\n\\nTesla\\'s third-largest individual shareholder, Indonesian billionaire KoGuan Leo, tweeted last week that he believed Musk had abandoned the electric car company. \"Tesla needs and deserves to have working full time CEO,\" he wrote, comparing Musk to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who\\'s helped build the iPhone maker into the titan of industry it is today. \"An executioner, Tim Cook-like is needed, not Elon.\"\\n\\nWhen Tesla investor and Motley Fool writer Brian Feroldi tweeted at Musk that shareholders were \"concerned that Twitter is consuming too much of your time,\" Musk defended himself saying he\\'d \"literally just finished\" a meeting about Tesla production progress in Texas.\\n\\nMany investors are not convinced. Tesla\\'s stock has fallen more than 68% so far this year, worse than the 64% dip for the speculative cryptocurrency bitcoin. The biggest selloffs for Tesla stock came after Musk announced his Twitter takeover plans, again when he became CEO, and now in the aftermath of the Twitter poll over his future leadership. Meanwhile, has sold nearly $40 billion worth of his Tesla shares throughout the years, even though he publicly said in April that he didn\\'t plan to sell any. In mid-December, he quietly sold about $3.6 billion, according to financial filings.\\n\\nMusk on Thursday reiterated his promise to stop selling shares, saying he wouldn\\'t sell anymore \"at a minimum 18 to 24 months, so you can count on no stock sales until 2025 or something.\" Tesla\\'s shares still ended the day down nearly 9% at trading close, and then fell another 1% on Friday morning.\\n\\nMusk\\'s behavior hasn\\'t just soured investors and customers. They\\'ve also hit his fans. Tom, the former Tesla investor who owned a car and reserved a spot with SpaceX\\'s Starlink satellite internet service, said he plans to buy an alternative electric vehicle when his lease expires next year.\\n\\n\"He was someone to look up to,\" Tom said. \"Now, I would rather pay more money to be with a different company.\"'],\n",

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that, based on its analysis, Tesla’s FSD feature “led to an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety based on insufficient adherence to traffic safety laws.” And it warned FSD could violate traffic laws at some intersections “before some drivers may intervene.”\\n\\n“The FSD Beta system may allow the vehicle to act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution,” said the recall notice, posted on NHTSA’s website.\\n\\nTesla will attempt to fix the the FSD feature, which costs $15,000, through an over-the-air software update, the notice added.\\n\\nWhile Tesla CEO Elon Musk has not yet commented on the nature or scope of the problem, he tweeted that “the word “recall” for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!”\\n\\nBut NHTSA said in a statement that “manufacturers must initiate a recall for any repair, including a software update, that remedies an unreasonable risk to safety.” The federal agency said it will “continue to monitor the recall remedies for effectiveness.”\\n\\nThe notice said that the problems are present with all cars with the current version of the FSD software, which is available on all four Tesla models, the Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y.\\n\\nIt also said Tesla has identified18 reports of incidents received between May 8, 2019, and September 12, 2022, that may be related to the conditions described above. It said Tesla is not aware of any injuries or deaths caused in those incidents. NHTSA itself has identified at least 273 crashes that involved one of Tesla’s driver assist systems.\\n\\nA Troubled Development\\n\\nFSD is considered key to the company’s basic business plan, given the premiums that drivers pay for the features, and it’s ability to attract buyers to chose Tesla cars in the first place. Tesla and Musk have repeatedly claimed that FSD, even in its current “beta” form, is safer than cars driven solely by humans. He told investors last month that Tesla has collected data from about 100 million miles of drivers using FSD outside of highways.\\n\\n“Our published data shows that improvement in safety,” he said. “It’s very clear. So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.”\\n\\nBut other safety experts have questioned the validity of Tesla’s safety claims. There have been high-profile accidents of Tesla cars using FSD or its more rudimentary predecessor known as “Autopilot.” Some of those accidents included fatalities.\\n\\nNHTSA is also investigating that predecessor, Autopilot. That technology combines lane-keeping assist with adaptive cruise control to keep a car in a lane on a highway, as opposed to the promise of “full self-driving,” which Tesla says aims to one day be able to operate a vehicle without human supervision on a city street.\\n\\nWhile “this recall seeks to address a specific set of concerns identified by the agency,” NHTSA’s statement said that this recall does not address its earlier investigations. “Accordingly, the agency’s investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot and associated vehicle systems remains open and active.”\\n\\nLast month, Tesla disclosed in the company’s annual financial report that it “has received requests from the US Justice Department for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features.”\\n\\nMoving Deadlines\\n\\nMusk has repeatedly predicted that the company would soon build a truly self-driving car. But it has also repeatedly pushed back its own self-imposed deadlines. Tesla owners have filed a class-action lawsuit over the predictions and missed deadlines, which is still pending.\\n\\n“Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,” Tesla’s lawyers wrote in a November 28 court filing, asking that the suit be dismissed.\\n\\nMusk has said for years that the price of “full self-driving” would increase periodically as it develops and moves closer to regulatory approval. He tweeted in May 2020 that when “full self-driving” had that approval, the feature would “probably” be worth more than “$100,000.” But as recently as a July 2021 call with investors, Musk said it was “debatable” that the feature was worth the $10,000 Tesla was charging at that time.\\n\\nIn September, when CNN Business spoke with 13 people who have cars with the “full self-driving” beta, the overwhelming majority, 11 people, said they felt it wasn’t worth $15,000. And it’s been the subject of controversy for years, including a recent ad that played during the Super Bowl in a few markets.\\n\\nTesla does not appear close to regulatory approval for “full self-driving.” In August of 2022, the California DMV said that the name “full self-driving” is “a deceptive practice” and grounds for suspending or revoking Tesla’s license to sell vehicles in the state.\\n\\nTesla, which has disbanded its public relations staff and has not responded to press inquiries for several years, could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nCNN’s Matt McFarland contributed to this report.',\n",

The union urged the NLRB for injunctive relief \"to prevent irreparable destruction of employee rights resulting from Tesla\\'s unlawful conduct.\"\\n\\nEmployees at the Buffalo facility on Tuesday launched organizing efforts under the union Tesla Workers United. Workers said they\\'re seeking a voice in the workplace, along with better pay and job security.\\n\\nThe employees are tasked with labeling videos from the company\\'s cars in order to improve Tesla\\'s driver assistance systems, marketed as Autopilot or Full Self Driving.\\n\\nThe typical data annotation job at Tesla involves identifying and describing objects in short clips captured by cameras and sensors on Tesla\\'s electric vehicles. Data labelers sometimes need to identify overlapping objects, like a wheel in front of a curb or a pedestrian obstructing the full view of a stop sign. They also review crash footage.\\n\\nData annotation specialists have their productivity tracked at a granular level. They\\'re rated on how many clips they can accurately annotate over short periods of time.\\n\\nLast year, Tesla laid off more than 200 employees who did this type of work in an Autopilot office in San Mateo, California. Hiring these kind of workers in Buffalo helped the company avoid paying a penalty to the state of New York, and to meet a commitment to create high tech jobs there.\\n\\nWorkers received an email Wednesday evening laying out a new policy that prohibits them from recording workplace meetings without the permission of all participants, Tesla Workers United said in a release Thursday. The group said that the policy violates federal labor law and flouts New York\\'s one-party consent law to record conversations.\\n\\n\"We\\'re angry. This won\\'t slow us down. This won\\'t stop us,\" Sara Costantino, a Tesla employee and member of the union\\'s organizing committee, said in a statement. \"They want us to be scared, but I think they just started a stampede.\"\\n\\nTesla and CEO Elon Musk have clashed with union proponents for years. In 2017, Tesla fired a union activist named Richard Ortiz, and in 2018, Musk tweeted a comment found to have violated federal labor laws. The NLRB ordered Tesla to reinstate Ortiz and to have Musk delete his tweet, which it said threatened workers\\' compensation. Tesla has appealed the administrative court\\'s ruling and his tweet remains.\\n\\nAfter hours on Thursday, Tesla responded to the Buffalo workers\\' complaint with a company blog post entitled, \"In Response to False Allegations.\" The recent terminations in the Autopilot team, Tesla said, amounted to about 4% of the employees in that group, and were part of performance review-related cuts being made at the company starting the week of Feb. 12.\\n\\nTesla said it identified which employees it would let go on Feb. 3, which the company said was before the union campaign was announced. Tesla also wrote that the Autopilot data labeling team in Buffalo has grown over the last six months from 437 employees to around 675 employees as of the start of this week.\\n\\nRead Tesla\\'s full response, here.\\n\\nWATCH: Tesla hired PR firm to monitor employees on social media amid union push'],\n",

He derided the broad offerings of competing automakers as simply a “shuffling” of many similar models.\\n\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act passed last year restored tax credits of up to $7,500 to buyers of the less expensive Tesla cars, the Model 3 and Model Y, as long as their list price is under $55,000. To qualify for the tax credit, the cars must be assembled in North America, so the eventual output from the plant in Mexico should qualify.\\n\\nMost of the global automakers already have assembly plants in Mexico. According to Reuters, there are 20 auto assembly plants in the country. General Motors has three, Ford has two, including one that make its Mustang Mach-E, the EV SUV that is a competitor to Tesla. Stellantis — which builds cars under the Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep brands — has three.\\n\\nIn addition Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Audi, Mazda, Mercedes, Kia and BMW all have plants in Mexico.\\n\\nAccording to statistics from the US Trade Administration, a part of the Commerce Department, Mexican plants were producing just under 4 million cars a year in the years before the pandemic reduced the supply of auto parts, particularly computer chips, and auto production worldwide. They produced about 3.5 million cars last year. That makes it the seventh largest country in terms of auto production.\\n\\nBut 90% of the cars it builds are exported, with 76% destined for the United States.'],\n",

He did not enter a plea and was ordered to remain held without bail in the San Mateo County Jail in Redwood City.\\n\\nPatel\\'s attorney, Josh Bentley, did not immediately respond to ABC News\\' request for comment.\\n\\nPatel is accused of intentionally trying to kill his wife and two young children by driving their car off a cliff on California\\'s scenic Highway 1, just south of the Tom Lantos tunnels, on the morning of Jan. 2. The California Highway Patrol said its officers were dispatched to the scene about 15 miles south of San Francisco at approximately 10:50 a.m. local time and, upon arrival, located a white Tesla some 300 feet down the cliff.\\n\\nFirst responders repelled down the cliff to rescue the occupants from the mangled vehicle -- two adults and two children. All four were then transported to a local hospital with \"serious injuries,\" according to the California Highway Patrol.\\n\\nAfter interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence from the scene, investigators developed probable cause to believe the incident was an intentional act and placed the driver -- identified as Patel -- under arrest for attempted murder and child abuse. Investigators were unable to determine what driving mode the Tesla was in at the time, but \"that does not appear to be a contributing factor in this incident,\" the California Highway Patrol said in a Jan. 3 press release.\\n\\nOn Friday, Patel was released from the hospital and subsequently booked into the San Mateo County Jail.

Their 7-year-old daughter was also badly hurt, while their 4-year-old son \"miraculously\" sustained only bruises, according to Wagstaffe, who said that\\'s why there were no enhancements added to the third count of attempted murder.\\n\\n\"By some miracle that I don\\'t understand, all of them have survived. I\\'m glad for that,\" Wagstaffe told reporters on Monday afternoon. \"But it doesn\\'t change [what] we\\'ve charged him with.\"\\n\\nThe district attorney said his office views the case as domestic violence.

He added the Tesla staff had agreed to respond by Tuesday.\\n\\nAbout a dozen police officers could be seen at the Shanghai protest and most of the videos of the other demonstrations also showed a large police presence at the Tesla sites.\\n\\nProtests are not a rare occurrence in China, which has over the years seen people come out in large numbers over issues such as financial or property scams, but authorities have been on higher alert after widespread protests in Chinese cities and top universities at the end of November against COVID-19 restrictions.\\n\\n\\'RETURN THE MONEY\\'\\n\\nOther videos appearing to be of Tesla owners protesting were also posted to Chinese social media platforms on Saturday.\\n\\nOne video, which Reuters verified was filmed at a Tesla store in the southwestern city of Chengdu, showed a crowd chanting, \"Return the money, refund our cars.\"\\n\\nAnother, which appeared to be filmed in Beijing, showed police cars arriving to disperse crowds outside a Tesla store.\\n\\nReuters was unable to verify the content of either video.\\n\\nTesla does not plan to compensate buyers who took delivery before the most recent price cut, a spokesman for Tesla China told Reuters on Saturday.\\n\\nHe did not respond when asked to comment on the protests.\\n\\nChina accounted for about a third of Tesla\\'s global sales in 2021 and its Shanghai factory, which employs about 20,000 workers, is its single most productive and profitable plant.\\n\\nAnalysts have been positive about the potential for Tesla\\'s price cuts to drive sales growth at a time when it is a year from announcing its next new vehicle, the Cybertruck.\\n\\n\"Nowhere else in the world is Tesla faced with the kind of competitors that they have here [in China],\" said Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility Ltd in Shanghai.\\n\\n\"They are in a much bigger EV market with companies that can price more aggressively than they can, until now.\"\\n\\nIn 2021, Tesla faced a public relations storm after an unhappy customer climbed on a car at the Shanghai auto show to protest against the company\\'s handling of her complaints about her car\\'s brakes.\\n\\nTesla responded by apologising to Chinese consumers for not addressing the complaints in a timely way.\\n\\nReporting by Brenda Goh, Zhang Yan and Casey Hall Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Tomasz Janowski\\n\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.'],\n",

The Model 3 is also assembled in Fremont, California.\\n\\nTesla plans to debut the latest Model 3 at a trade fair in Beijing on Saturday and some of its new features, including a rear display for back-seat passengers, seemed aimed at Chinese car buyers. It said it would also show the new model at the Munich auto show.\\n\\nImages of the exterior showed small changes that gave the sedan a sleeker front and new headlights.\\n\\nThe new Model 3 also promises a longer driving range of 606 km (377 miles) for the standard version based on China\\'s testing standards, about 9% higher than the base model it replaces in China.\\n\\nTesla said it had started taking orders in China, where it would begin deliveries in the fourth quarter, and in other markets where it exports to from Shanghai, including Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.\\n\\nThe new Model 3 should sell well outside China where there is less competition in EVs, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.\\n\\n\"But in China, we have already seen plenty of new models rolling out since the (Shanghai) auto show in April with similar and even better features and lower prices,\" he added.\\n\\nPROJECT \\'HIGHLAND\\'\\n\\nReuters first reported last November that Tesla was developing a revamped Model 3 in a project codenamed \"Highland\".

The regulators are demanding information from the automaker about whether consumers could try to circumvent the safety controls on Tesla’s driver-assist technology.\\n\\nIn a letter to Tesla dated July 26 and made public by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week, US authorities expressed concern that the recent discovery of the setting — which has since been widely and unofficially dubbed “Elon mode” — could encourage unsafe driving behavior.\\n\\n“NHTSA is concerned that this feature was introduced to consumer vehicles and, now that the existence of this feature is known to the public, more drivers may attempt to activate it,” wrote NHTSA Acting Chief Counsel John Donaldson in the letter. “The resulting relaxation of controls designed to ensure that the driver remain engaged in the dynamic driving task could lead to greater driver inattention and failure of the driver to properly supervise Autopilot.”\\n\\nThe letter was first reported by Bloomberg. NHTSA’s demand for information comes after a user on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, in June claimed to have accessed a non-public setting in Tesla’s software such that it no longer periodically prompts, or “nags,” drivers to apply torque to the steering wheel while Autopilot or Full Self-Driving modes — the company’s more advanced driver-assist package — are active.\\n\\nThe X user later claimed to have performed a 600-mile test drive with the reminders disabled.\\n\\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. NHTSA declined to comment.\\n\\nCNN has not been able to independently verify the X account’s claims or the identity of the account holder.

It also requests records of crashes and near-misses involving Tesla vehicles that had the hidden setting enabled.\\n\\nThe letter set a deadline of Aug. 25 and warned that failure to comply could result in fines of up to more than $26,000 a day.\\n\\nA subsequent filing released by NHTSA showed that Tesla did respond to the agency’s request for information by the deadline, but that the company requested and received confidential treatment for its report, meaning the information Tesla provided to NHTSA will not be made public.\\n\\nThe probe into the apparent hidden feature comes as part of a wider, long-running review by NHTSA of Tesla’s Autopilot software, following multiple crashes allegedly attributed to the technology.\\n\\nThis fall, two lawsuits against Tesla over its Autopilot technology are expected to go to trial. The first, scheduled for September, involves a 2019 crash in California that saw a Tesla Model 3 driving off of a highway and slamming into a tree at high speed.

Black employees regularly encountered graffiti, including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment, in bathroom stalls, within elevators, and even on new vehicles rolling off the production line, the EEOC said.\\n\\nThe EEOC’s investigation also found that those who raised objections to racial hostility suffered various forms of retaliation, including terminations, changes in job duties, transfers, and other adverse employment actions.\\n\\nThe EEOC investigated Tesla after EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows filed a commissioner’s charge alleging that Tesla violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by subjecting Black employees to an unlawful hostile work environment and retaliating against employees for opposing harassment. Title VII prohibits racial harassment and requires employers who receive harassment complaints to take prompt and appropriate action to investigate and stop it.\\n\\nAfter first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through conciliation, the EEOC filed its lawsuit (EEOC v Tesla, Inc., Case No. 4:23-cv-04984) in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The EEOC’s lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, and back pay for the affected workers, as well as injunctive relief designed to reform Tesla’s employment practices to prevent such discrimination in the future.\\n\\n“Combatting systemic harassment in workplaces is a key strategic enforcement priority for the EEOC. Unfortunately, as the lawsuits EEOC has filed this fiscal year show, racial harassment remains a persistent problem in employment. Every employee deserves to have their civil rights respected, and no worker should endure the kind of shameful racial bigotry our investigation revealed,” said Burrows. “Today’s lawsuit makes clear that no company is above the law, and the EEOC will vigorously enforce federal civil rights protections to help ensure American workplaces are free from unlawful harassment and retaliation.”\\n\\nEEOC San Francisco District Office Director Nancy Sienko said, “When you let a standard slip, you’ve set a new standard. Determining that prolific racial slurs do not merit serious discipline and failing to correct harassing conduct sends an entirely wrong message to employees. It also violates an employer’s legal responsibility to act swiftly and effectively to stop race-based harassment.”\\n\\nEEOC San Francisco District Office Regional Attorney Roberta L. Steele said, “The allegations in this case are disturbing. No worker should have to endure racial harassment and retaliation to earn a living six decades after the enactment of Title VII.”\\n\\nFor more information on race discrimination, please visit https://www.eeoc.gov/racecolor-discrimination.

One ex-employee described a video of a man approaching a vehicle completely naked.\\n\\nAlso shared: crashes and road-rage incidents. One crash video in 2021 showed a Tesla driving at high speed in a residential area hitting a child riding a bike, according to another ex-employee. The child flew in one direction, the bike in another. The video spread around a Tesla office in San Mateo, California, via private one-on-one chats, “like wildfire,” the ex-employee said.\\n\\nOther images were more mundane, such as pictures of dogs and funny road signs that employees made into memes by embellishing them with amusing captions or commentary, before posting them in private group chats. While some postings were only shared between two employees, others could be seen by scores of them, according to several ex-employees.\\n\\nTesla states in its online “Customer Privacy Notice” that its “camera recordings remain anonymous and are not linked to you or your vehicle.” But seven former employees told Reuters the computer program they used at work could show the location of recordings – which potentially could reveal where a Tesla owner lived.\\n\\nOne ex-employee also said that some recordings appeared to have been made when cars were parked and turned off. Several years ago, Tesla would receive video recordings from its vehicles even when they were off, if owners gave consent. It has since stopped doing so.\\n\\n“We could see inside people\\'s garages and their private properties,” said another former employee. “Let\\'s say that a Tesla customer had something in their garage that was distinctive, you know, people would post those kinds of things.”\\n\\nTesla didn\\'t respond to detailed questions sent to the company for this report.\\n\\nAbout three years ago, some employees stumbled upon and shared a video of a unique submersible vehicle parked inside a garage, according to two people who viewed it. Nicknamed “Wet Nellie,” the white Lotus Esprit sub had been featured in the 1977 James Bond film, “The Spy Who Loved Me.”\\n\\nThe vehicle’s owner: Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who had bought it for about $968,000 at an auction in 2013. It is not clear whether Musk was aware of the video or that it had been shared.\\n\\nThe submersible Lotus vehicle nicknamed \"Wet Nellie\" that featured in the 1977 James Bond film, \"The Spy Who Loved Me,” and which Tesla chief executive Elon Musk purchased in 2013.

More than a dozen agreed to answer questions, all speaking on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nReuters wasn’t able to obtain any of the shared videos or images, which ex-employees said they hadn’t kept. The news agency also wasn’t able to determine if the practice of sharing recordings, which occurred within some parts of Tesla as recently as last year, continues today or how widespread it was. Some former employees contacted said the only sharing they observed was for legitimate work purposes, such as seeking assistance from colleagues or supervisors.\\n\\nLABELING PEDESTRIANS AND STREET SIGNS\\n\\nThe sharing of sensitive videos illustrates one of the less-noted features of artificial intelligence systems: They often require armies of human beings to help train machines to learn automated tasks such as driving.\\n\\nSince about 2016, Tesla has employed hundreds of people in Africa and later the United States to label images to help its cars learn how to recognize pedestrians, street signs, construction vehicles, garage doors and other objects encountered on the road or at customers’ houses. To accomplish that, data labelers were given access to thousands of videos or images recorded by car cameras that they would view and identify objects.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: The forward-facing camera of a Tesla Model S containing Autopilot features is pointed out during a 2015 Tesla event in Palo Alto. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Acquire Licensing Rights\\n\\nTesla increasingly has been automating the process, and shut down a data-labeling hub last year in San Mateo, California. But it continues to employ hundreds of data labelers in Buffalo, New York. In February, Tesla said the staff there had grown 54% over the previous six months to 675.\\n\\nTwo ex-employees said they weren’t bothered by the sharing of images, saying that customers had given their consent or that people long ago had given up any reasonable expectation of keeping personal data private. Three others, however, said they were troubled by it.\\n\\n“It was a breach of privacy, to be honest. And I always joked that I would never buy a Tesla after seeing how they treated some of these people,” said one former employee.\\n\\nAnother said: “I’m bothered by it because the people who buy the car, I don\\'t think they know that their privacy is, like, not respected … We could see them doing laundry and really intimate things. We could see their kids.”\\n\\nOne former employee saw nothing wrong with sharing images, but described a function that allowed data labelers to view the location of recordings on Google Maps as a “massive invasion of privacy.”\\n\\nDavid Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, called sharing of sensitive videos and images by Tesla employees “morally reprehensible.”\\n\\n“Any normal human being would be appalled by this,” he said. He noted that circulating sensitive and personal content could be construed as a violation of Tesla’s own privacy policy — potentially resulting in intervention by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which enforces federal laws relating to consumers’ privacy.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the FTC said it doesn’t comment on individual companies or their conduct.\\n\\nTo develop self-driving car technology, Tesla collects a vast trove of data from its global fleet of several million vehicles. The company requires car owners to grant permission on the cars’ touchscreens before Tesla collects their vehicles’ data. “Your Data Belongs to You,” states Tesla’s website.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model 3 vehicle is shown using the Autopilot Full Self Driving Beta software (FSD) while navigating a city road in Encinitas, California, February 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake Acquire Licensing Rights\\n\\nIn its Customer Privacy Notice, Tesla explains that if a customer agrees to share data, “your vehicle may collect the data and make it available to Tesla for analysis. This analysis helps Tesla improve its products, features, and diagnose problems quicker.” It also states that the data may include “short video clips or images,” but isn’t linked to a customer’s account or vehicle identification number, “and does not identify you personally.”\\n\\nCarlo Piltz, a data privacy lawyer in Germany, told Reuters it would be difficult to find a legal justification under Europe’s data protection and privacy law for vehicle recordings to be circulated internally when it has “nothing to do with the provision of a safe or secure car or the functionality” of Tesla\\'s self-driving system.\\n\\nIn recent years, Tesla’s car-camera system has drawn controversy. In China, some government compounds and residential neighborhoods have banned Teslas because of concerns about its cameras. In response, Musk said in a virtual talk at a Chinese forum in 2021: “If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.”\\n\\nElsewhere, regulators have scrutinized the Tesla system over potential privacy violations. But the privacy cases have tended to focus not on the rights of Tesla owners but of passers-by unaware that they might be being recorded by parked Tesla vehicles.\\n\\nIn February, the Dutch Data Protection Authority, or DPA, said it had concluded an investigation of Tesla over possible privacy violations regarding “Sentry Mode,” a feature designed to record any suspicious activity when a car is parked and alert the owner.\\n\\nReuters Image Acquire Licensing Rights\\n\\n“People who walked by these vehicles were filmed without knowing it. And the owners of the Teslas could go back and look at these images,” said DPA board member Katja Mur in a statement. “If a person parked one of these vehicles in front of someone’s window, they could spy inside and see everything the other person was doing. That is a serious violation of privacy.”\\n\\nThe watchdog determined it wasn’t Tesla, but the vehicles’ owners, who were legally responsible for their cars’ recordings. It said it decided not to fine the company after Tesla said it had made several changes to Sentry Mode, including having a vehicle’s headlights pulse to inform passers-by that they may be being recorded.\\n\\nA DPA spokesperson declined to comment on Reuters findings, but said in an email: “Personal data must be used for a specific purpose, and sensitive personal data must be protected.”\\n\\nREPLACING HUMAN DRIVERS\\n\\nTesla calls its automated driving system Autopilot. Introduced in 2015, the system included such advanced features as allowing drivers to change lanes by tapping a turn signal and parallel parking on command. To make the system work, Tesla initially installed sonar sensors, radar and a single front-facing camera at the top of the windshield. A subsequent version, introduced in 2016, included eight cameras all around the car to collect more data and offer more capabilities.\\n\\nMusk’s future vision is eventually to offer a “Full Self-Driving” mode that would replace a human driver. Tesla began rolling out an experimental version of that mode in October 2020. Although it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel, it currently offers such features as the ability to slow a car down automatically when it approaches stop signs or traffic lights.\\n\\nTesla\\'s Autopilot system\\n\\nThis excerpt from the owner’s manual for the Tesla Model X explains the car’s Autopilot system, including the cameras that record video of the vehicle’s surroundings. Reuters found that Tesla employees shared clips that captured sensitive and embarrassing personal moments. Acquire Licensing Rights\\n\\nIn February, Tesla recalled more than 362,000 U.S. vehicles to update their Full Self-Driving software after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it could allow vehicles to exceed speed limits and potentially cause crashes at intersections.\\n\\nAs with many artificial-intelligence projects, to develop Autopilot, Tesla hired data labelers to identify objects in images and videos to teach the system how to respond when the vehicle was on the road or parked.\\n\\nTesla initially outsourced data labeling to a San Francisco-based non-profit then known as Samasource, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The organization had an office in Nairobi, Kenya, and specialized in offering training and employment opportunities to disadvantaged women and youth.\\n\\nIn 2016, Samasource was providing about 400 workers there for Tesla, up from about an initial 20, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\n\\nBy 2019, however, Tesla was no longer satisfied with the work of Samasource’s data labelers. At an event called Tesla AI Day in 2021, Andrej Karpathy, then senior director of AI at Tesla, said: “Unfortunately, we found very quickly that working with a third party to get data sets for something this critical was just not going to cut it … Honestly the quality was not amazing.”\\n\\nA former Tesla emp loyee said of the Samasource labelers: “They would highlight fi re hydrants as pedestrians … They would miss objects all the time. Their skill level to draw boxes was very low.”\\n\\nSamasource, now called Sama, declined to comment on its work for Tesla.\\n\\nTesla decided to bring data labeling in-house. “Over time, we’ve grown to more than a 1,000-person data labeling (organization) that is full of professional labelers who are working very closely with the engineers,” Karpathy said in his August 2021 presentation.\\n\\nKarpathy didn’t respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nTesla’s own data labelers initially worked in the San Francisco Bay area, including the office in San Mateo. Groups of data labelers were assigned a variety of different tasks, including labeling street lane lines or emergency vehicles, ex-employees said.\\n\\nAt one point, Teslas on Autopilot were having difficulty backing out of garages and would get confused when encountering shadows or objects such as garden hoses. So some data labelers were asked to identify objects in videos recorded inside garages. The problem eventually was solved.\\n\\nIn interviews, two former employees said in their normal work duties they were sometimes asked to view images of customers in and around their homes, including inside garages.\\n\\n“I sometimes wondered if these people know that we\\'re seeing that,” said one.\\n\\n“I saw some scandalous stuff sometimes, you know, like I did see scenes of intimacy but not nudity,” said another. “And there was just definitely a lot of stuff that like, I wouldn\\'t want anybody to see about my life.”\\n\\nAs an example, this person recalled seeing “embarrassing objects,” such as “certain pieces of laundry, certain sexual wellness items … and just private scenes of life that we really were privy to because the car was charging.”\\n\\nMEMES IN THE SAN MATEO OFFICE\\n\\nTesla staffed its San Mateo office with mostly young workers, in their 20s and early 30s, who brought with them a culture that prized entertaining memes and viral online content. Former staffers described a free-wheeling atmosphere in chat rooms with workers exchanging jokes about images they viewed while labeling.\\n\\nAccording to several ex-employees, some labelers shared screenshots, sometimes marked up using Adobe Photoshop, in private group chats on Mattermost, Tesla’s internal messaging system. There they would attract responses from other workers and managers. Participants would also add their own marked-up images, jokes or emojis to keep the conversation going. Some of the emojis were custom-created to reference office inside jokes, several ex-employees said.\\n\\nOne former labeler described sharing images as a way to “break the monotony.” Another described how the sharing won admiration from peers.\\n\\n“If you saw something cool that would get a reaction, you post it, right, and then later, on break, people would come up to you and say, ‘Oh, I saw what you posted. That was funny,’” said this former labeler. “People who got promoted to lead positions shared a lot of these funny items and gained notoriety for being funny.”\\n\\nSome of the shared content resembled memes on the internet. There were dogs, interesting cars, and clips of people recorded by Tesla cameras tripping and falling. There was also disturbing content, such as someone being dragged into a car seemingly against their will, said one ex-employee.\\n\\nVideo clips of crashes involving Teslas were also sometimes shared in private chats on Mattermost, several former employees said. Those included examples of people driving badly or collisions involving people struck while riding bikes – such as the one with the child – or a motorcycle. Some data labelers would rewind such clips and play them in slow motion.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A camera is seen on the body of a Tesla electric vehicle (EV) during a media day for the Auto Shanghai show, April 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song Acquire Licensing Rights\\n\\nAt times, Tesla managers would crack down on inappropriate sharing of images on public Mattermost channels since they claimed the practice violated company policy. Still, screenshots and memes based on them continued to circulate through private chats on the platform, several ex-employees said. Workers shared them one-on-one or in small groups as recently as the middle of last year.\\n\\nOne of the perks of working for Tesla as a data labeler in San Mateo was the chance to win a prize – use of a company car for a day or two, according to two former employees.\\n\\nBut some of the lucky winners became paranoid when driving the electric cars.\\n\\n“Knowing how much data those vehicles are capable of collecting definitely made folks nervous,\" one ex-employee said.\\n\\nReported by Steve Stecklow and Waylon Cunningham in London and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco.

It underpins BMW\\'s big push into electric vehicles. BMW\\n\\nMUNICH, Germany — BMW and Mercedes are making their biggest push yet into electric cars in a bid to fend off rising competition from Chinese players and catch up with U.S. giant Tesla . In the last few days, as part of the IAA Mobility motor show in Munich, Germany, the auto giants took the wraps off electric concept cars and new platforms for their future battery-powered vehicles. European carmakers, which have been perceived to be behind Chinese companies like Warren Buffett-backed BYD and Elon Musk\\'s Tesla, have had to move quickly to show the market they\\'re ready to be major players in the electric era. On Sunday, Mercedes-Benz unveiled its Concept CLA Class, an electric vehicle built on a new architecture that will underpin future battery cars from the German auto giant. The company said the concept car has a range of 750 kilometers (466 miles) as well as an ability to reach a range of 400 kilometers with just 15 minutes of charging. Mercedes CEO Ola Kallenius talked up the car, calling it a \"revolutionary development\" for the German firm. \"With those efficiency numbers, that kind of range, that kind of fast charging, I am not aware of any vehicle, in that class that can match that,\" Kallenius told CNBC\\'s Annette Weisbach on Sunday.\\n\\nOn Saturday, rival BMW showed off the \"Vision Neue Klasse,\" another electric concept car that highlights the company\\'s EV ambitions. Neue Klasse is BMW\\'s new architecture for its EVs. The first vehicles based on this platform are set to enter production in 2025. \"In only two years\\' time, these cars will hit the road and with that, overall, we lead BMW to a new era of innovation and sustainability. That\\'s the purpose of our show here at the IAA,\" BMW CEO Oliver Zipse told CNBC\\'s Arabile Gumede. Zipse said BMW is going to double its EV sales this year. By the end of 2023, 15% of BMW\\'s global sales will be battery EVs, he added. Mercedes and BMW\\'s dedicated EV platforms are a departure from previous architecture where they would adapt combustion engine or hybrid models and add batteries. This is the companies\\' biggest push yet toward a new platform for the electric vehicle era. Analysts said that Mercedes and BMW\\'s announcements are big steps but might leave them still lagging behind Tesla.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\n\"The new platforms at Mercedes and BMW showcase, for the first time, what the European OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] will be capable of. These cars are likely still a year away, but their specifications show that European OEMs will be able to create compelling products,\" Daniel Roeska, senior research analyst at Bernstein Research, told CNBC via email. Roeska said that these new platforms \"will close a large portion of the gap\" to Tesla and the Chinese players, \"but not all the way.\"\\n\\nPrice war in focus\\n\\nBMW and Mercedes are wading further into an increasingly competitive electric vehicle market, broadly dominated by Tesla and various Chinese players. Tesla commanded 20% of the global EV market in the second quarter, followed by 15% for BYD, according to Counterpoint Research. And the competition has become more fierce thanks to a price war largely sparked by Tesla. The U.S. automaker began cutting prices in 2023, vowing to sacrifice margins in the short term for market share gain. Mercedes and BMW both play in the premium segment of the market, where cars like Tesla\\'s Model S and Model X compete. As they prepare to release more EVs in the coming years, Mercedes maintains its focus is not on pushing large volumes. \"We are not pushing volume, we are focusing on value over volume,\" Kallenius said.\\n\\nwatch now\\n\\nMeanwhile, Volkswagen\\'s strategy appears to be to release cars at various prices to capture different segments of the market. The company announced Sunday that it will launch eleven new all-electric models by 2027, underscoring its EV push. In 2026, Volkswagen said it plans to launch the ID. 2all, an electric vehicle that will sell for less than 25,000 euros ($26,942). The German auto giant showed off the ID. GTI Concept electric vehicle at the IAA show, and said a production version of the car is scheduled to hit the road in 2027.\\n\\nTesla, China dominate with tech in focus'],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 27, 0, 0): [\"AUSTIN, Texas\\n\\nIn March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.\\n\\nHe soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.\\n\\n“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.\\n\\nPonsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”\\n\\nWhat Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.\\n\\nThe Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.\\n\\nInside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.\\n\\nManagers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.\\n\\nIn most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.\\n\\nNeither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.\\n\\nTesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.\\n\\nThen, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.\\n\\nThe directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.\\n\\n“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”\\n\\nTesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.\\n\\nDriving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.\\n\\nAt the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.\\n\\nReuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.\\n\\nTesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.\\n\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.\\n\\nData collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.\\n\\nRecurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.\\n\\nElectric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.\\n\\nTesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.\\n\\nTesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.\\n\\nRecurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters – including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.\\n\\nTesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”\\n\\nFailed tests and false advertising\\n\\nTesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.\\n\\nOne of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.\\n\\nThe study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.\\n\\nThe EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.\\n\\nLike their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.\\n\\n“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”\\n\\nEV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.\\n\\nTesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.\\n\\nMercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.\\n\\nFord and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nWhatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.\\n\\nEPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.\\n\\nThe EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.\\n\\nThe EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.\\n\\nPannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.\\n\\n“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”\\n\\nJonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.\\n\\nAll five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.\\n\\nTesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.\\n\\nOnly two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.\\n\\nEdmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.\\n\\n“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”\\n\\nSouth Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.\\n\\nThe KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.\\n\\nKorean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”\\n\\nCreating a diversion\\n\\nBy last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.\\n\\nAs sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.\\n\\nTesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.\\n\\nTesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”\\n\\nSuch advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.\\n\\nThe office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.\\n\\nAdvisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.\\n\\nIf the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.\\n\\nTesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.\\n\\nThe update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.\\n\\nThe team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.\\n\\nIn late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.\\n\\n“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.\\n\\nReuters could not establish how long the practice continued.\\n\\nTesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.\\n\\nOn the road\\n\\nBy the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.\\n\\nConcerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.\\n\\nPonsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”\\n\\n“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.\\n\\n“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”\\n\\nThe next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.\\n\\nUndeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”\\n\\nAfter doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.\\n\\n“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”\\n\\nRange Rage By Steve Stecklow in London and Norihiko Shirouzu in Austin Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park in Seoul and Peter Henderson in San Francisco Art direction and lead illustration: Eve Watling Video Production: Lucy Ha and Ilan Rubens Edited by Brian Thevenot\"],\n",

Representatives from PepsiCo, which reserved 100 Semis shortly after its reveal, were on hand to receive the first batch of trucks.\\n\\nTesla says the Semi is powered by four independent motors on the rear axles, can accelerate 0-60mph in 20 seconds, and has a battery range of up to 500 miles. Prices may start at $150,000, and there have been a number of orders from businesses like Walmart and FedEx in the low-dozens range.\\n\\n“It looks sick.”\\n\\nStanding on a stage flanked by four Tesla Semis, two of which wrapped in Pepsi and Frito Lay logos, Musk spoke about the need to reduce the amount of carbon emissions produced by the shipment of goods across the planet. But after paying lip service to the mission of fighting climate change, he quickly pivoted to his distinct brand of showmanship.\\n\\n“It looks sick,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on stage at the event. “You want to drive that. I mean, that thing looks like it came from the future.” Musk later referred to the Semi as “a beast.”\\n\\nScreengrab: Tesla\\n\\nMusk ticked off a number of features he said will make the Semi the most efficient, most desirable, and most driveable truck on the road. The truck will feature a new 1,000-volt powertrain architecture that Musk said will factor into future product development at Tesla. The Semi has traction control to prevent jackknifing, regenerative braking for increased battery efficiency, and an automatic clutch for seamless highway driving.\\n\\n“It’s a step-change in technology in so many ways,” Musk said.\\n\\nOver the weekend, Musk revealed that one of Tesla’s battery powered class 8 semi-trucks had completed a 500-mile trip fully loaded with 81,000 pounds of cargo. The trip took place from Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, to San Diego at the southern tip of the state. At the event, Musk clarified that the trip was accomplished without needing to recharge the battery.\\n\\nTesla is positioning the Semi as the future of trucking. But while the company has struggled to get production started, the rest of the trucking industry has already embraced EVs. Major equipment manufacturers like Daimler, Volvo, Peterbilt, and BYD, have been working on their own electric long-haulers. The Tesla Semis delivered today were the final piece of a $30.8 million project partially funded by the California Air Resource Board, according to Bloomberg. Even Nikola Motors, which has struggled with fraud allegations and executive turnover, has delivered an electric truck before Tesla.\\n\\nStill, battery-powered electric vehicles will face steep challenges, from weight restrictions to the availability of convenient charging stations, before they can be widely adopted. Truck stops, for example, are largely unprepared to handle the power needs of electric tractor-trailers and their gigantic batteries.\\n\\nTwo years ago, Bill Gates said that “even with big breakthroughs in battery technology,” electric vehicles were simply not ready to tackle long-haul trucking. “Electricity works when you need to cover short distances, but we need a different solution for heavy, long-haul vehicles,” Gates wrote. (Musk’s response to Gates was to post crude memes on Twitter, of course.)\\n\\nTesla’s “V4” charging cable immerses the conductors in coolant tubes. Image: Tesla\\n\\nMusk addressed charging during the event, revealing that Tesla has developed a new liquid-cooled charging connector capable of delivering 1 megawatt of direct current power. “It’s going to be used for Cybertruck, too,” Musk added to cheers from the audience. (The similarly much-delayed Cybertruck is expected to go into production in the latter half of 2023.) He also spoke about needing to uncouple Tesla’s Superchargers from the grid to ensure they can continue to deliver power during an outage.\\n\\nTrucks are a key component of Musk’s “Master Plan Part Deux,” in which he vowed to expand the company’s lineup of vehicles to “cover the major forms of terrestrial transport,” including a semi truck.\\n\\nDuring the event, Musk spoke about Tesla’s current product lineup, which has been criticized as stale as compared to other automakers that frequently release refreshed versions of past models. Standing in front of an image of Tesla’s vehicle lineup, including the forthcoming Cybertruck and a shrouded vehicle labeled “robotaxi,” Musk said Tesla wasn’t like other car companies.'],\n",

Both automakers' electric vehicles use the Combined Charging System (CCS), which has been a standard in North America. To make Tesla Superchargers available to Ford and GM owners with CCS-compatible vehicles, the companies will provide adapters to hook into the Tesla stations.\\n\\nThe NACS charging system will be available on all Ford, GM and Rivian electric vehicles beginning with the 2025 model year.\\n\\nBetween Tesla's own vehicles, and Rivian, GM and Ford adopting the NACS standard, 7 out of the 10 top selling EVs in 2022 will use Tesla's charging technology by 2025. And Hyundai may follow-suit.\\n\\nThe South Korean automaker is also considering a switch to the NACS system, its CEO said last week.\\n\\nTesla dominates the U.S. electric vehicle market\\n\\nAs demand for electric cars and trucks has increased, automakers have moved quickly to debut vehicles that rely only on battery power, as opposed to hybrid or internal combustion engines. Twenty-four brands offered pure electric vehicles in the U.S. in 2022. As of 2022, EVs represent 8% of the overall market, up from just over 5% in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.\\n\\nDespite a rush to meet demand across the rest of the industry, Tesla maintains dominance over the EV sector. Of all EVs sold in the U.S. in 2022, Tesla vehicles made up 64.5% of the market. Ford held the second-largest market share behind Tesla, selling 7.5% of all EVs.\\n\\nTesla tops EV sales in 2022\\n\\nPart of what makes Tesla so dominant is the diversity and familiarity of its electric vehicle lineup. Tesla offered four EVs in 2022, more than any other company, and they aren’t brand-new releases.\\n\\nThe Model S was first released in 2012, while Tesla’s most recent new release, the Model Y, first hit the market in 2020. For comparison, Ford’s first EV, the Mustang Mach-E, first went on sale in December 2022.\\n\\nTesla still controls the electric vehicle market\\n\\nSince Tesla electric vehicles greatly outnumber EVs from other brands, the NACS system is already the most common EV charger in North America, according to Tesla. Tesla maintains nearly 7,000 charging stations in the U.S., giving drivers access to more than 33,000 NACS ports, according to the Department of Energy.

When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.\\n\\n“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Elluswamy said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.\\n\\nWhen Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”\\n\\nTesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.\\n\\nThe New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.\\n\\nWhen asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, \"It does not.\"\\n\\nElluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang.\\n\\nAndrew McDevitt, the lawyer who represents Huang’s wife and who questioned Elluswamy’s in July, told Reuters it was “obviously misleading to feature that video without any disclaimer or asterisk.”\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board concluded in 2020 that Huang’s fatal crash was likely caused by his distraction and the limitations of Autopilot. It said Tesla’s “ineffective monitoring of driver engagement” had contributed to the crash.\\n\\nElluswamy said drivers could “fool the system,” making a Tesla system believe that they were paying attention based on feedback from the steering wheel when they were not.

Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory will put the redesigned Model 3 into production in the third quarter of 2023, they said.\\n\\nIt was not clear when production would start at the Fremont plant or how large a cost savings Tesla would achieve from the redesign as it works with suppliers.\\n\\nThe effort spotlights an approach to vehicle development pioneered by Tesla and now being copied by other automakers, including Toyota Motor (7203.T), that removes complexity – and cost – in production.\\n\\nIt is also an example of a key project at Tesla that has rolled ahead even as Chief Executive Elon Musk has focused on his troubled acquisition of Twitter in recent months, an area of concern for Tesla investors.\\n\\nTesla did not respond to a written request for comment from Reuters.\\n\\nCHANGE YOU CAN SEE\\n\\nThe redesign for the Model 3 builds on the revamp of the Model S -- Tesla’s premium EV sedan -- that was released last year. That redesign added an airplane-style yoke in place of a traditional steering wheel and removed buttons and traditional air vents as part of a minimalist interior where the centerpiece is a 17-inch electronic display.\\n\\nThe Model 3, Tesla’s cheapest EV starting at just under $47,000 in the United States, had been the automaker’s best-seller but is being overtaken by the Model Y crossover. With only four models in production, styling changes to any part of Tesla’s lineup carry an outsized importance compared to established automakers.\\n\\nEd Kim, president of AutoPacific Group, which tracks market trends and production, said the current Model 3 has already been updated from the version that first went on sale in 2017 because of the way Tesla updates battery performance, information and entertainment options through software, even if it still looks the same.\\n\\n[1/2]A Tesla Model 3 sedan, its first car aimed at the mass market, is displayed during its launch in Hawthorne, California, U.S. March 31, 2016.

It has also designed a structural battery pack that does away with more expensive modules.\\n\\nMusk has said Tesla is looking to drive costs down through simplification and working on a small-car platform that would be half the cost of the Model 3.\\n\\n\"Over and over, we found parts that are not needed. They were put in there just in case or by mistake. We eliminated so many parts from a car that did nothing,\" Musk said in an interview at a Baron Funds conference earlier in the month.\\n\\nThe approach is part of what has made Tesla the most profitable electric vehicle maker while many rivals are still running at a loss.

Nothing is announced, and the frenzy is based mainly on Mexican officials saying Tesla boss Elon Musk will have a phone call with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\\n\\nThe northern industrial state of Nuevo Leon seemed to have an early edge in the race.\\n\\nIt painted the Tesla logo on a lane at the Laredo-Colombia border crossing into Texas last summer and is erecting billboards in December in the state capital, Monterrey, that read \"Welcome Tesla.\"\\n\\nThe state governor\\'s influencer wife, Mariana Rodriguez, was even shown in leaked photos at a get-together with Musk.\\n\\nHowever, López Obrador appeared to exclude the semi-desert state from consideration Monday, arguing he wouldn\\'t allow the typically high water use of factories to risk prompting shortages there.\\n\\nThat set off a competitive scramble among other Mexican states. The governors\\' offers ranged from crafty proposals to near-comic ones.\\n\\n\"Veracruz is the only state with an excess of gas,\" quipped Gov. Cuitláhuac García of the Gulf Coast state, before quickly adding \"gas … for industrial use, for industrial use!\"\\n\\nA latecomer to the race, García had to try harder: He noted Veracruz was home to Mexico\\'s only nuclear power plant. And he claimed Veracruz had 30% of Mexico\\'s water, though the National Water Commission puts the state\\'s share at around 11%.\\n\\nThe governor of the western state of Michoacan wasn\\'t going to be left out. Gov. Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla quickly posted a mocked-up ad for a Tesla car standing next to a huge, car-sized avocado — Michoacan\\'s most recognizable product — with the slogan \"Michoacan — The Best Choice for Tesla.\"\\n\\n\"We have enough water,\" Ramírez Bedolla said in a television interview he did between a round of meetings with auto industry figures and international business representatives.\\n\\nMichoacan also has an intractable problem of drug cartel violence. But similar violence in neighboring Guanajuato state hasn\\'t stopped seven major international automakers from setting up plants there.\\n\\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel García had to think fast to avoid being shut out entirely.\\n\\nGarcía reached out to the western state of Jalisco, whose governor, Enrique Alfaro, belongs to the same small Citizen\\'s Movement party. Together, the two came up with an alliance Thursday that would allow trucks from Jalisco preferential use of Nuevo Leon\\'s border crossing, the same one where a \"Tesla\" lane appeared last year.\\n\\nJalisco has a healthy foreign tech sector, but most importantly, it has more water than Nuevo Leon.\\n\\nLópez Obrador\\'s focus on water might be more about politics than about droughts, said Gabriela Siller, chief economist at Nuevo Leon-based Banco Base.

Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said his understanding is that it won\\'t be a plant, but rather an ecosystem of suppliers.\\n\\nMusk at times has floated the idea of building a $25,000 electric vehicle that would cost about $20,000 less than the current Model 3, now Tesla\\'s least-expensive car. Many automakers build lower-cost models in Mexico to save on labor costs and protect profit margins.\\n\\nA Tesla investment could be part of \"near shoring\" by U.S. companies that once manufactured in China but now are leery of logistical and political problems there. That those companies will now turn to Mexico represents the Latin American country\\'s biggest foreign investment hope.\\n\\n\"The fight among states to attract investments from this nearshoring phenomenon is going to be tough, complicated,\" Michoacan’s Ramírez Bedolla said.\\n\\nAs Ramírez Bedolla put it, \"wherever Tesla sets up, it is going to be big news in Mexico.\"'],\n",

Indonesia, for example, has offered to reduce import duties from 50% to zero for EV makers planning investments, a move seen aimed at attracting Chinese players and Tesla.\\n\\nTesla first tried to enter India in 2021 by pushing officials to lower the 100% import tax for EVs. Last year, the talks between Tesla and the Indian government collapsed when officials conveyed the company would have to first commit to local manufacturing.\\n\\nMore recently, Tesla has told Indian officials it is keen to set up a local factory and make a new EV priced around $24,000, roughly 25% cheaper than its current entry model, for both the Indian market and export.\\n\\nTesla\\'s senior public policy and business development executive Rohan Patel has in recent weeks met top officials privately. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who held talks with CEO Elon Musk in June, has been tracking progress closely, Reuters has reported.\\n\\nIndian officials conveyed there will be no special incentives for Tesla\\'s market entry, and the proposal for a low import tax, conditional on a manufacturing commitment, was touted by Tesla to keep both sides happy, the sources said.\\n\\nOne of the sources said Tesla told Indian officials a potential India factory could operate at full capacity by 2030.\\n\\nOutside the United States, Tesla currently has a plant in Shanghai - its largest factory worldwide - and one outside Berlin. It is building a new plant in Mexico that will focus on a new mass-market EV platform Musk has said will slash costs for consumers.\\n\\nReporting by Aditi Shah, Aditya Kalra and Nikunj Ohri; Additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya; Editing by Kevin Krolicki, Raju Gopalakrishnan and Sharon Singleton\\n\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.']}"
