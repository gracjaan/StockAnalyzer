       "  'The Company Also Announces Extension of Its Partnership Agreement with Etraveli Group\\n\\nNORWALK, Conn., Sept. 25, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) today announced that it intends to appeal the European Commission\\'s recently announced decision to prohibit the Company\\'s acquisition of Etraveli Group, from CVC Capital Partners (\"CVC\"), to the European courts.\\n\\nThe Company strongly believes the Commission is wrong on both the facts of the case and the law applicable to this transaction, which was cleared unconditionally by multiple competition authorities, including the UK Competition & Markets Authority and U.S. FTC. The Commission has fundamentally misconstrued the highly competitive travel markets for flights and accommodations, and its decision is an unexplainable departure from the Commission\\'s own Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, which are legally binding on the Commission. The acquisition, which would have combined two separate but complementary Europe-based businesses operating within separate, highly competitive industries, would have delivered tremendous benefits for consumers and partners by bringing more options and competitive pricing. Booking Holdings regrets very much the lack of convergence of the European Commission with other major international enforcers on this pro-competitive transaction.\\n\\nThe European Commission\\'s decision does not alter Booking Holdings\\' commitment to continue building its already growing and successful flights offering at Booking.com, and providing increased choice and transparency for consumers, as the company today also announces an extension of an existing and long-standing commercial partnership agreement between Booking.com and Etraveli Group through at least December 2028.\\n\\nWhile the acquisition would have allowed Booking.com to fully harness all of Etraveli Group\\'s capabilities and management team to offer a better flights product and better deals for consumers through, among other things, greater strategic and commercial alignment and enhanced integration, the continued partnership with Etraveli Group will further strengthen and accelerate Booking.com\\'s ongoing work to build a frictionless global flights offering, which is already live in over 50 countries, and deliver even more value to travelers.\\n\\n\"The European Commission\\'s decision not only departs from settled law and precedent but it deprives consumers of travel options that they are entitled to have,\" said Booking Holdings\\' Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Fogel. \"We are proud of the progress we are making in providing a high quality flights product through our existing commercial partnership with Etraveli Group. Today we are pleased to announce an extension of that partnership through 2028, and as we go forward together, our focus will continue to be on advancing the creation of a better, more flexible consumer travel experience that provides more value to customers and partners.\"\\n\\nAbout Booking Holdings\\n\\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG) is the world\\'s leading provider of online travel and related services, provided to consumers and local partners in more than 220 countries and territories through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com , Priceline , Agoda , Rentalcars.com , KAYAK and OpenTable .

Go ahead, gentlemen.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings\\' second quarter conference call. I\\'m joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter, we continue to see robust leisure travel demand, which helped drive the strong results we are announcing today. The 268 million room nights booked in the second quarter increased by 9% year over year, and gross bookings of $39.7 billion grew 15% year over year and was the highest quarterly gross bookings ever.\\n\\nBoth room nights and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the favorable demand environment. Revenue growth of 27% in Q2 also nicely outperformed our expectations. The strong top-line results in the quarter, combined with better-than-expected marketing efficiency, helped drive our Q2 adjusted EBITDA to about $1.8 billion, which is an increase of 64% versus Q2 last year and meaningfully exceeded our prior growth expectations of about 35%. Looking at the month of July, we have seen an acceleration in year-over-year room night growth relative to the 9% growth we reported for Q2.\\n\\n10 stocks we like better than Booking Holdings\\n\\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Booking Holdings wasn\\'t one of them! That\\'s right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of August 1, 2023\\n\\nWe estimate July room nights increased by about 20% year over year, benefiting from the easier comparison to July 2022. Overall, we have been very pleased to see our strong performance in the first half of the year, which has benefited from the continued strength and resiliency of overall travel demand. Our solid start to the year, combined with what we currently believe will be a new all-time high for Q3 summer travel period results and an improved outlook for the full year, which David will discuss in detail in his comments. While the near-term results and outlook are encouraging, we remain focused on what is important for the business for the long term, which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our enterprise while simultaneously remaining cost conscious.\\n\\nWe are seeing progress and momentum across several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long term. These initiatives include: Advancing our connected trip vision; further integrating AI technology into our offerings; continue to grow alternative accommodations; and building more direct relationships with our travel bookers. Starting with the connected trip. This is our long-term vision to make looking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners.\\n\\nTo be clear, this is not a discrete product we will introduce at some point in the future. Instead, this is a meaningfully enhanced way for a booker to experience and utilize Booking.com. Over time, you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform to move us another step closer to this long-term vision. And importantly, this approach allows us to realize the benefits while we are building toward that future state.\\n\\nWe believe that the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating travelers than it should be. And eventually, our connected trip vision will greatly improve it via technology. Looking at the other side of the travel marketplace, we believe that our supplier partners will also benefit greatly from the connected trip as it will provide more opportunities to personalize and merchandise their offerings. We continue to build out our connected vision and have much more work to do, but we\\'re pleased with the progress we have made so far and expect it to ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform.\\n\\nWe\\'ve always envisioned the connected trip is having AI technology at its center. Across our company, we have a long history with investing in AI technology and incorporating it into our platforms in order to optimize interactions with both our travelers and partners. This is an area where we believe we are well-positioned, given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for years. In addition to the many current applications for AI on our platforms, we believe that we can build an even more compelling and differentiated offering for our bookers.\\n\\nWe leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience, a connected trip that would be more responsible to our bookers\\' needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. Generative AI may play an important role in delivering the connected trip experience to our bookers and our teams have been hard at work to integrate this exciting technology into our offerings in innovative ways. For example, in early July, Priceline unveiled its 2023 summer release. which delivered over 40 new booking tools and upgrades, including Penny.\\n\\nPenny is Priceline\\'s generative AI travel assistant. Priceline has currently positioned Penny at the end of the funnel on the checkout page, where Penny can answer travel-related questions that a customer may have when they reached the checkout page. Penny is built on Priceline\\'s own proprietary technology and data and also leverages large language model technology to power its conversational capabilities. The combination of these technologies allows for innovations like the ability to make a booking directly in the chat interface.\\n\\nThe Priceline team is rapidly gaining insights on booker questions, concerns and behavior is Penny continues to interact with customers. The plan is to further enhance penny over time by leveraging these valuable learnings. Around the same time, as Priceline summer release, Booking.com launched its own AI trip planner, which began rolling out on the mobile app in the U.S. to Genius customers.\\n\\nIn contrast to Penny, the AI trip planner sits toward the top of the funnel, where travelers are in the discovery and planning processes for their trips. Built upon the foundation of Booking.com\\'s existing machine learning models that recommend accommodation options to millions of travelers on the platform every day, the AI trip planner is also partially powered by large language mall technology to create a conversational experience for people to start their planning processes. The AI trip planner advances planning by providing travelers with a rich visual list of destinations and properties, including Booking.com\\'s live pricing information with deep links to view more details on the options. From the chat interface of the AI trip planner, bookers can tap on any recommended accommodation they\\'re interested in and then complete the reservation.\\n\\nAccretive to our approach here is to marry our own proprietary data and machine learning models with degenerative AI technology. This allows us to provide a conversational interface with the traveler while leveraging our own recommendation engine to provide accurate detail and real-time information on the property recommendations. Like Priceline, the Booking.com team is already gaining valuable insights from the interactions with bookers even though the trip planner is in beta and is still currently in a relatively limited rollout. While we are excited by these new advances at Booking.com and Priceline, it is, of course, still very early days, and we have much more to learn about how customers will ultimately want to interact with this new technology.\\n\\nIn addition, we mentioned last quarter that OpenTable and Kayak were experimenting with AI plug-ins. And we will continue to examine all areas of our company to ensure we are taking advantage of AI-created efficiencies. We are confident in our company\\'s ability to benefit from AI development and improve our products for our customers given our many years\\' experience in AI, our travel-related data and connections to our supply partners and our human and financial capital. Across our businesses, we have two equally important customers, our travelers and our supply partners, with each representing one side of our marketplace.\\n\\nFor our supply partners, we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand in developing products and features to help support their businesses. One area of focus for us on the supply side continues to be our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com. Alternative accommodation room nights grew faster than our traditional hotel category at about 11% year over year for the second quarter and represented about 34% of Booking.com\\'s total room nights, which is 2 percentage points higher than in Q2 2022. This is a new all-time high mix of our total room nights.\\n\\nWe are pleased to see continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodation of supply growth, both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about $7 million by the end of the second quarter, which is about 8% higher than Q2 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time.\\n\\nIn the second quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continue to increase year over year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and we believe will result in increased traveler loyalty. About 48% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter, which is about 6 percentage points higher than in Q2 2022, an acceleration in the mix shift compared to Q1 and all-time high in terms of mix of bookings coming from our mobile apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength of travel demand so far this year and signs of what we expect to be a record summer travel season. Our teams continue to innovate and execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps us position our business well for the long term. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers, both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company.\\n\\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I\\'ll review our results for the second quarter, as well as our thoughts for Q3 and for the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful.\\n\\nInformation regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings investor relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now on to our second quarter results. Again, it\\'s a tough year-over-year comparison in the second quarter due to a strong rebound in travel after Omicron in Q2 last year.\\n\\nWe were pleased to have blurred 9% room night growth in Q2, which was a few percentage points better than our expectations. Looking at our year-over-year room night growth by region in the second quarter, Asia was up over 40%. Rest of the world was up low double digits. Europe was up a couple of points and the U.S.\\n\\nwas down slightly. It\\'s helpful to remember that the U.S. was very strong last Q2 and stronger than Q1 and Q3 versus 2019 due to a rebound from Omicron. Compared to 2019, our Q2 global room night growth was 26%, which was in line with Q1.\\n\\nFor the second quarter, all our major regions grew at a similar rate versus 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com, expanded further versus 2019 than it did in Q1. The Q2 booking window of Booking.com also expanded versus 2022. As Glenn mentioned, our mobile apps represented about 48% of our total room nights in the quarter, which was about 6 percentage points higher than the second quarter of 2022.\\n\\nWe continue to see an increased mix of our room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The down channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2022. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic in Q2, we saw the international mix of our room nights fully recover to 2019 levels. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter were higher than Q2 2022 as the second quarter of 2022 benefited from the strong recovery in new bookings following the relaxation of travel restrictions in many parts of the world post Omicron.\\n\\nOur cancellation rates in the second quarter continue to be below 2019 levels. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q2 room night growth was about 11% year over year and the global mix of our tag recombination room it was about 34%, which was higher than about 32% in Q2 2022. Versus 2019, alternative combination room night growth was about 38%. Q2 gross bookings increased 15% year over year or 16% on a constant-currency basis.\\n\\nThe 15% increase in gross bookings was 6 points higher than the 9% room night increase due to 5% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple of points from flight bookings partially offset by the 1 percentage point of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation in constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights in Asia and a lower mix of room nights from the U.S. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 9 percentage points year over year. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down.\\n\\nWe continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 8% year over year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com\\'s flight offering. Revenue for the second quarter came in nicely ahead of our expectations, increasing 27% year over year or about 28% on a constant-currency basis. Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points above last year, which was in line with our expectations.\\n\\nOur underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 4% year over year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q2 2022 due to higher ROIs in our pay channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year over year due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend.\\n\\nMarketing and Merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 was about 60 basis points lower than last year, which is better than our expectation. Relative to expectations, this is primarily due to better ROI in our pay channels, as well as lower-than-expected merchandising spend, which was impacted by the booking window being more expanded than we expected in the quarter, which will push merchandising expense into future periods at the time revenue is recognized. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 30 basis points compared to last year, a bit better than our expectation. About 48% of Booking.com\\'s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from about 38% in Q2 2022.\\n\\nOur more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 20% year over year, which is below our expectations due to lower IT expenses in the quarter, including some impact from phasing of IT spend into later in the year. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion in the second quarter, which was up 64% year over year and would have been up 70% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was well above our expectations due to a stronger top line, the efficiencies in marketing and merchandising and lower-than-expected IT expenses.\\n\\nOur adjusted EBITDA margins increased by about 7 percentage points versus Q2 2022. Non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $37.62 per share, which was up 97% year over year. Our average share count in the second quarter was 9% below Q2 2022 and 15% below Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $1.3 billion in the quarter.\\n\\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $15.7 million was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $15.3 billion due to the $1.9 billion of debt issuances in May 2023 and the $1.6 billion of free cash flow generated in the second quarter offset by the $3.1 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter. In the first half of the year, we repurchased $5.1 billion of our shares, which represented 5% and of our year-end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $19 billion from the $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year.\\n\\nWe remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within four years from when we started the program at the beginning of this year, assuming no major downturn in the travel environment. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter of 2023. In July, we saw year-over-year room night growth of about 20%, up from 9% in Q2. Looking across our major regions.\\n\\nIn July, we saw Asia up about 45%; rest of World, up over 20%; Europe up mid-teens; and the U.S. up mid-single digits. When comparing versus 2019, July room night growth was in a similar range to the 26% growth in Q2. The U.S.\\n\\nwas our most recovered region with growth at over 30% versus 2019. Our comments for the third quarter made the assumption that room night growth will be up low double digits year on year, assuming some moderation in growth from July due in part to harder prior-year comparables in August and September. You\\'ll recall from our commentary on the third quarter of 2022, that room night growth versus 2019 was 4% in July 2022 and 10% in August and September 2022. In addition, we expect that due to expanded booking window in the first half of the year stayed in Q3, but there will be fewer last-minute bookings for stays in the rest of Q3.\\n\\nWe expect Q3 gross bookings to grow about seven points faster the room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and a few points of positive impact from FX movements. We expect accommodation constant currency ADRs to be about in line with Q3 2022, including a couple of points of pressure from the changes in regional mix. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be around 19%, slightly above last year due to a more positive impact from timing in part due to the expanded booking window in the first half of this year, and from increased revenue from payments. We expect we expect these will be partially offset by a higher mix of flights and increased merchandising spend, some of which is related to bookings we received earlier in the year.\\n\\nWe expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 to be slightly lower than last year. We expect Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 20 basis points higher last year, primarily due to higher gross bookings mix. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q3 to grow year over year about 30% due to higher personnel and related expenses, higher IT expenses, including the impact of phasing from Q2 and higher indirect taxes in G&A.\\n\\nThe year-over-year growth in our more fixed expenses includes about 7 percentage points from changes in FX. The difference between the 20% growth in our more fixed expenses in Q2 and a 30% growth in Q3 is driven mainly by FX and major one. Taking all into account, we expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be around 20% higher than last year. Given the strong level of bookings that we\\'ve seen, we are updating our commentary for the full year.\\n\\nWe currently expect gross bookings to grow slightly over 20%, up from our previous expectation for low teens growth. We expect full year room night growth in the mid-teens and constant currency combination ADRs were up slightly for the year, including a couple of points of pressure from changes in regional mix. We currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year over year by about 20 basis points, down from our previous expectation of 50-basis-points increase. The reduction in our full year take rate is driven by less of a benefit from timing, including due to the higher growth rate we expected earlier in this year and also due to expanded booking window.\\n\\nAlso from stronger performance, which drove a higher mix of flights than expected earlier in the year. We currently expect marketing merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below in 2022 as compared to our previous expectation for it to be similar to 2022. The improvements in our expectation is driven primarily by higher ROIs in off paid channels. We currently expect our more fixed expenses to grow about 25%, up from our previous expectation to around 20%.\\n\\nThe increase in our expectation is driven primarily by variable components of personnel expense due to the overperformance versus expectations at the start of the year, as well as higher indirect taxes, which are generally tied to revenues and some additional FX pressure. We manage our more fixed expenses very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results and the momentum in the business that we moved into Q3.\\n\\nWe\\'ll now move to Q&A. Adam, can you please open the lines?\\n\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open.\\n\\nLloyd Walmsley -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTwo, if I can. First, thanks for some of the color on the Gen AI trip planners you guys have rolled out Wondering how you guys think about that strategically and balance that with what search engines are doing. Do you think this brings you guys more direct traffic? Or do you think when you look at what some other players like Google are doing with their new search experience, like how that might change traffic flows in the travel space? And then, second one, you mentioned marketing ROI improvements and efforts to improve efficiency. Is that a function of just making higher ROI targets or just other changes you\\'re making within marketing? Any commentary you can give there would be great.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nLloyd, why don\\'t I take the first one about AI, and then I\\'ll let David talk about marketing and ROIs. So first and while it\\'s an easy answer, it\\'s the true answer, which is nobody knows yet how there\\'s a very new technology generative AI, how that\\'s going to play out in the long run. That\\'s one. Two, even though we don\\'t know how it\\'s going to come out, we know it\\'s very important that we continue to do everything we can to explore experiment, see what might be very helpful to our travelers and to our supply partners, too, along with internally to do things better internally for us.\\n\\nEvery company is doing that, including the big search engines like Google and they\\'re coming out what they can do, and nobody knows. A couple of things though I am fairly certain that history provides a good road map. And that is there will be changes, but companies that are able to adapt quickly, be agile, have great technology experts will benefit from these kinds of changes. We saw it as things, for example, like when the mobile for came out, we were able to adapt quickly, adjust, and we got, I think, a very good advantage from that.\\n\\nI think that we will hopefully get the same type of benefits as this new technology Generate AI comes out. But one thing I didn\\'t mention in the prepared remarks was, I mentioned all the companies, but I didn\\'t mention Agoda. So Agoda is doing some very good things in terms of internally, how can we use Gen AI to become more efficient with all types of code co-pilot type systems. So there are lots of different things that we\\'re playing with all one.\\n\\nI\\'m really happy the way that we\\'re doing from different directions, having price line doing it at the bottom of the phone, see how that works. Doing Booking.com\\'s AI, Trip Planner at the top, how that\\'s doing that. The ChatGPT plug-ins from OpenTable and from Kaya. So being able to do all these things from the different brands and being able to learn from each other what works, what does the work where should you put more emphasis where should we put less emphasis.\\n\\nI think that will help us have an advantage over many other companies that may not have the scale experts, the -- basically the capital to put into what could be a very, very exciting future for us. We\\'ll see how it plays out. And of course, nobody knows how regulations are going to play into this, and that is something that could affect everybody. And David, I don\\'t know if you want to talk about the market ROIs.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. Sure. Thank you, Lloyd, thanks for the question. So first of all, let\\'s clarify that this is not a change in our approach relative to our design to lean in this year to recovery in travel market.\\n\\nWe\\'re still leading in through a recovering travel market. And you can see from our top-line numbers, we\\'re doing quite well. So that hasn\\'t changed, and marquee merchandising investment in total will still be higher this year than it was in 2019. It kind of goes hand-in-hand with that lead-in comment.\\n\\nWhat I would say and what you\\'re seeing is within that envelope as we look for ways to optimize our marketing spend, we\\'ve done a little bit more optimization than we expected, not going into all the components of where that\\'s happening. But we\\'re looking at channels for incrementality or return to direct, things like that and consistently testing across a very large marketing spend. You see that during the quarter, we spent about $1.8 billion on marketing. So it\\'s a large amount of money that we\\'re spending across that spectrum.\\n\\nWe are always looking at ways to kind of optimize different spend, diet channels and different approaches. So it\\'s really more to do with our ongoing effort to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. But again, within the context of we\\'re still leaning in and looking to take share as the market continues to recover from COVID.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open.\\n\\nMark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Two questions, please. First, Glenn, have you noticed any changes in the type of travel demand? And I mean, short versus longer stay, rural suburban versus urban. And then, I wanted to ask the CFO question on AI, which is when you think about the impact that AI has had and Gen AI could have on the business, from a financial perspective, do you think that that\\'s -- David, do you think that\\'s more likely to be on the monetization side or on the cost efficiency side? And I\\'m sure you\\'re going to say both, but if you could be a little bit more -- if you have any more specifics on which of those you think could be more and could be more impacted by the application of Gen over time?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nMark, I\\'m smiling because I want to do number two first and to say both, but I\\'ll do it in the order you gave it. So this is a question that comes up a lot because -- and I mentioned in the last call about how I\\'m always looking for the smoke signals is something changing. And some of the key things I always look at, are people trading down in terms of star ratings or are people going for a lower length of stay. Or are people shifting to areas that may be cheaper travel than what previously was more expensive travel, always looking for some sort of early warning signal that something is happening.\\n\\nI do not see that yet. I do not see that in any of those areas. And that\\'s what we\\'re seeing right now. In terms of the AI, it\\'s a very interesting question.\\n\\nAnd of course, if we knew the answer, we have a good sense of where should we be putting most of our investment dollars in our people put them into the area is going to give us the best return. But the things I mentioned in the first question, Nobody knows the answer to these things. These are all just guesses. So at this stage, it\\'s very important to spread the bets around and see where the return is coming to see where we want to put people to work, put more money to work and see what\\'s going to come back.\\n\\nOne of the DNA of our company has always been experiment, see what works and keep pushing in what\\'s better, working better than other areas. So we\\'re gonna be doing a lot of different experimentation. And I think that\\'s going to go on for some time before we really have a good sense where the best returns are. I think, in the long run, of course, all -- both things you mentioned are going to give tremendous benefits to everybody.\\n\\nBut if you\\'re correct to ask the question, which things first and how much? And that is not known yet.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\\n\\nJustin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\n\\nObviously, very strong in Asia. Maybe talk a little bit about what you\\'re seeing there? And are you able to take some share from direct bookings at hotels or competitors. And then, I thought your marketing ROI comment was very interesting in a very crowded quarter for marketing spend. So can you talk about -- is it the direct traffic that\\'s helping you be more judicious with your marketing spend? Or how are you getting that way up?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo I\\'ll let David speak second about if you want to give any more color into the marketing question. I\\'ll leave out Asia. So yes, very pleased with Asia. Very nice to see the second quarter numbers and even nicer to see July accelerating like that.\\n\\nThat\\'s great. And obviously, that\\'s a function of Asia took more time to recover the restrictions dropped later. We\\'re doing a year-over-year comp. So we\\'re getting some benefit out of that.\\n\\nAnd by the way, just everybody there is no confusion in China not producing significant they\\'re far behind in terms of outbound recovery, and we\\'re much more an outbound player there, and I don\\'t expect a recovery in China for us for some time. significant time probably. So overall, it\\'s good. There are a lot of factors happening there.\\n\\nThere are very similar to other parts of the world where people wanted to travel. They\\'re going out there. They\\'re doing it. And we have done a very good job the same way we did in the U.S.\\n\\nand we did in Europe is making sure that when people wanted a trial, we were there for them, and we\\'re seeing the results right there. And David, if you want to give any more color into that marketing question.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. Justin, I think, I gave a fair amount of color in my first answer, so I\\'m not going to repeat it. You did ask about when the direct makes place into this as well. And yes, obviously, as our direct mix is increasing as we commented it continues to do so.\\n\\nThat helps, but we\\'re also getting helped from just looking across our total spend on marketing and looking at pockets of efficiency using some of the areas I talked about earlier.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\\n\\nKevin Kopelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Could you give us an update on your efforts and progress in the North America vacation rental market, just where you\\'re at on that initiative?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nKevin, so I\\'m very pleased that we\\'re continuing to advance while we talked about the overall -- we\\'ll call it, alternative accommodations is the way we define that area. We talk globally about our 11% growth being faster then the 9% for the overall company, that 11% was a Booking.com number. But in terms of North America, specifically, are less reduced to the U.S., which is the area where I think we all are more focused on. We have said many, many times, I have seen many, many times, that\\'s an area of focus for us.\\n\\nWe know we\\'re under index. We know the areas we had to improve the product. And we talked in the last call and the call before that, too, probably, about the things we\\'re doing to improve it, and that is both on the supply side, making sure we\\'re improving things so that people who own homes, people manage apartments, people who are in this space, say, \"I\\'m sorry, but Booking.com, you\\'re not doing certain things that you need to do for me. I\\'m glad that we are doing those things, they will then be willing and are being to list their properties on our platform.\" That\\'s great.\\n\\nAnd on the other side, as I talked about last time, is the importance, OK, we got the properties now. We\\'ve got to make sure people know about it, and I talked last time again about awareness and then we need to bring that up to. This is not a thing you saw overnight. This is something that you day by day, step-by-step, grind it out, and that\\'s what we\\'re doing in all different areas, and we\\'re seeing the progress.\\n\\nSo are we there? Yes? No, not even close to there yet. But the good thing is we\\'re making the progress and that\\'s all upside for us down the road. So we\\'re going to keep on plugging away at it, and I think, we\\'ll continue to experience good returns as we continue to invest in the area.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Anmuth -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nCan you talk about where you\\'re seeing the biggest impacts of connected trip? And how big of an impact do you think that\\'s happening in terms of your outsized growth in the quarter? And then, just switching to mobile, the 48% of room nights booked through the apps. Anything you can share in terms of better frequency and loyalty among those app users?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo I\\'ll leave the second one, what David wants to actually reveal in that area of specifics. I\\'m not sure if he does or doesn\\'t. Regarding the connected trip, a couple of things on that. So let\\'s start off right at the start that the Connect trip is not producing material numbers increases in our -- what we\\'re doing right now.\\n\\nThe good numbers that we\\'re showing right now are not because of a connected trip, and it\\'s just too small to show that. Imagine we\\'re building it in orange. Until every piece is in place. You\\'re not getting a lot of advantage from this arch.\\n\\nRight now build in the arch. So you see parts that are showing up, but not the big effect. So for example, really happy about one element, which is you have to have a flight product. And we\\'re doing 58% year-over-year growth in tickets and flights, that\\'s greater -- I mean, that\\'s a really good number.\\n\\nIt shows that we\\'re producing a good flight product, we\\'ll get that going. And then, the other areas that we have to build out, like things like the attractions, things like the right part gets to you from the hotel to the airport or from your home to the airport, things like that. Building all those things out. And then, of course, the glue, payments.\\n\\nThat\\'s very important to make sure the whole thing is working correctly. We\\'re able to give benefits value to both the traveler and enable our suppliers to have an opportunity to give types of benefits, so they\\'ll win that deal. These are things we need payments to do, and we\\'re making great progress and really happy to see that number up there, they\\'re 48% in the growth from last year. So all these elements are being worked on, but that is not what\\'s producing the very good returns in Q2.\\n\\nThe flip side that says look at all the potential future we have down the road. That\\'s really encouraging to me. So I\\'m very happy where we are. I\\'m glad with the progress we\\'re making, but it should not be misthought that this is the thing that\\'s produced Q2\\'s numbers.\\n\\nAnd David, I don\\'t know if you want to talk about mobile app, anything there in terms of repeat?\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. Thank you will. So Doug, you\\'re going to ask the question?\\n\\nDoug Anmuth -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nNo, go ahead.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSo in terms of when you think about what\\'s happening with the app. There are three ways of people can interact with us directly. They can come through the app. They can come to us directly on a desktop device and come to a strictly on a mobile device.\\n\\nAnd out of those three, not too surprisingly, the app is the is the sickest channel in terms of frequency and loyalty, as you mentioned, which is why, obviously, after is now a very high percentage of direct and has become an increasing pesage of direct, and we think that\\'s a good thing. But relative to differences in frequency and laws, we\\'re not in a position to get into those today, but it is definitely our best channel in terms of frequency and loyalty.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd Doug, one other thing I want to add to this is, Doug, is the importance of the app and the connected trip. It\\'s one of the important parts along with the other ones because one of the things that we really believe is important when you\\'re traveling is to get advice deals, all sorts of things that you want to have your travel agent in your pocket. Well, in your phone, that is the travel agent in the pocket. And then, you throw on top of this, all the Gen AI stuff, all that.\\n\\nThere\\'s some real potential opportunities down the road that people are traveling, they\\'re going to have a much better experience than they have had in the past, and that\\'s what I\\'m looking for down the road.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\\n\\nLee Horowitz -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\n\\nYour direct booking mix improvement remain impressive. I guess, for starters, can you help us unpack what drove the acceleration in mix toward direct in the quarter? Something specific on your run that you guys are doing that drove that improvement quarter on quarter? And how should we take that being replicated going forward? And then, secondly, are we getting to a point where direct mix may fully offset your growth into lower-margin business and thus, over time, allow you to actually walk margins back toward 2019 levels? Just any commentary there in terms of direct mix and margins over time would be helpful.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nLee, I\\'ll let David talk about whether one wants to talk about where the margins may go with that, but I\\'ll talk to just in general, why do we continue quarter after quarter, it seems to be improving our direct mix. And I believe the reason is because people like the product. That\\'s the thing that helps. I\\'ve used it and they decide to come back because we\\'re giving the best prices.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to most select selection, the greatest election. We\\'re making it easier for them to do it. And we\\'re providing great customer service, something goes wrong to fix it. The reason I use, and I\\'m not going to list some other new retail online retailers, there are some big ones I use.\\n\\nI use it constantly. I do it because it\\'s better. And in the end, that\\'s what wins as customers interest, they come back with a better product, when the people believe in trust is the reason people are loyal to a brand. That\\'s what we\\'re building here.\\n\\nAnd I believe that\\'s why we are slowly, incrementally building out that direct mix. I think that\\'s the biggest thing for me. David, you can add if you want to add anything to that? And also, I\\'m not sure what you want to talk about in terms of margins where people come direct and what that may do in the long run to our margin profile, EBITDA margin profile.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. Lee, we, obviously, go next is very helpful for the business. And of course, we\\'re talking about here really direct mix within our accommodations business is kind of core business. And we\\'ve mentioned before that we believe that we can continue to improve margins a little bit from where they were in 2023, but we\\'re not trying to walk them all the way back to where they were in 2019.\\n\\nWe all have significant businesses that are lower margin businesses than we had in 2019 when we have a large price business, we\\'re moving toward having a life payments business. So direct mix can, obviously, offset some of the pressure in the business. but don\\'t expect it to walk our margins back to 2019. That\\'s not what we\\'ve talked about gains, but we do believe it\\'s one of the factors that can lead us to have continued improvement from where we are now.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nEric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\n\\nMaybe against your broader long-term goals for growth that you called out earlier in your comments. Would love to get any update about how you\\'re feeling about supply growth with respect to shared accommodations and/or local experiences against continuing to diversify supply and build out more elements of the connected trip. And how do those factor in as elements of investment beyond 2023, looking out into next year?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nEric, so the important thing is always priorities. What\\'s the most important thing -- and we\\'ve mentioned numerous times in terms of our alternative accommodations, how important it is to continue to build out the supply there. We have a large number of listings that\\'s true. I\\'ve talked about many times, though, you have to have the right type of listing in the right locations.\\n\\nAnd we talked in the past, and it\\'s not done yet, in the U.S., getting the right accommodations in the right places so that we -- you will come, they have something to buy. That\\'s very important. That\\'s a top priority. When you ship down to something like attractions, not as important right now, it\\'s important, but it\\'s not as high a priority as getting an ultra combination.\\n\\nThat\\'s one of the most critical things is making sure we\\'re spending the time, energy, effort and money in the place they\\'re giving us the best return. We have good attractions from third-party connections. We have the key ones. And someday, it will be important to build out further along that.\\n\\nBut for right now, for this year and next year, I want to make sure that we\\'re going to have the bigger bang for the buck, which is being sure we have the right number and the right types of alternative accommodations on our platform. Super clear.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\\n\\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Just going back to the U.S. business. You highlighted mid-single-digit growth in the U.S.\\n\\nCan you talk about endow that\\'s trending relative to your competitors? And does that capture the amount of Americans traveling over to Europe? Or is that including in your European road lights?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDavid, I\\'ll let you go on both those. I mean, I\\'m not sure what you want to talk about in terms of us versus competitors or not.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. Let me clarify. First of all, when we talk about these regions on a geography basis, we\\'re talking about on a book basis. So yes, Jed, it does capture bookings being made by U.S.\\n\\ntravelers including those that are moving overseas, which is one of the reasons why we\\'re getting growth. We mentioned that we\\'re back to a mid-single-digit growth in July in the U.S. after seeing a very, very small decline in growth in Q2. And actually, that was really just April and May.\\n\\nBy the time we got to June, we were back to growth as well. And then, the April, May comparisons relate you to the really strong rebound we saw, particularly in those months when the old player was declared in Omicron last year. So we got a little bit of a funky comparison on there. So I think, we\\'re doing well in the marketplace.\\n\\nIt\\'s too early to kind of call how we see us doing any against the market for a single quarter, we like to kind of look at that on a longer-term basis, you can look at how the year pans out. I would just point out that relative to the market, we mentioned in July, when over 30% growth in the U.S. versus 2019, not significantly well ahead of any market data points. Market is perhaps closer to breakeven, maybe slightly positive compared to 2019.\\n\\nWe\\'re up 30%, so we tend to look at it over the longer period of time. And we\\'ll have a better view on exactly how we\\'re doing in the U.S. relative to the market as the year develops and as the year ends. As Glenn mentioned, we\\'re pleased with many of our programs there.\\n\\nWe also know there\\'s a lot of upside for us to continue to push more into the U.S. marketplace.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Brignall with Redburn. Your line is open.\\n\\nAlex Brignall -- Redburn Partners -- Analyst\\n\\nI just have one on the full year guidance. Obviously, the big change are the revenue divided by growth being up only 0.2% year on year. So could you just talk a little bit about how that will map next year? Obviously, pulling forward some bookings brings forward the marketing and also, therefore, it has the impact on EBITDA. But can you talk about the longer-term dynamic presumably that has no impact on 2024 and on the margin trajectory you see going forward?\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes, Alex, let me take that. So yes, I mean, as you called out in the prepared remarks, there are two factors that are causing us to take the guidance to take rates to call our number down a little bit from where we were before. And actually, both of kind of what I call good things happening within the business. So the first is that the business is growing faster and the booking window has steel on gate compared to where we thought we\\'d be this year, which means that we\\'re not going to get all the benefit from timing recovery this year.\\n\\nSome of that timing recovery will be delayed into next year. So that we should get back as a positive that piece of the reduction will get back as positive next year. The fact that flight is growing faster than we expect is also putting a little bit of pressure on margin. But as Glenn said, that\\'s a good thing as well because we are building out more capabilities and more opportunities to work with our customers across connected transactions.\\n\\nSo those are the two main dynamics, one of which we will get back in terms of the timing recovery, which we thought would happen this year will now happen more likely over two years.\\n\\nAlex Brignall -- Redburn Partners -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. That\\'s really helpful, David. As a follow-up, One of the things that\\'s, obviously, changed is that some of your marketing dollars which come below the revenue line, have turned into merchandising dollars above the revenue line. And so, it seems really like that revenue line is very, very hard to model.\\n\\nIf we were to think of things in terms of EBITDA divided by gross bookings, is there any meaningful reason why your core business or the accommodation business outside of payments and flights and all of the sort of businesses that dilute that bigger should not see a return to pre-COVID profitability, if not improvement, if you increase direct mix. So if I just think accommodation EBITDA divided by gross bookings, is there any reason why that should be less profitable in the future than it was before COVID.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s, obviously, a different way of looking at the EBITDA margins than we do, but you\\'re right, obviously, some of the contra revenue because of merchandising impacting the revenue line. The diet mix will, obviously, help overcome pressures in the accommodation business. Obviously, it seems like alternatives become slightly bigger, seeing Asia becomes slightly bigger. So I think, when we\\'ve talked about the long-term model for the business, assume that the core accommodations business can get back to in the rough region where it was 2019-ish, and then the impact on EBITDA margins in the overall business will be driven by the mix of some of the newer businesses will become quite large in terms of particularly payments and flights, neither which were a major factor in 2019.\\n\\nWhat I would point to is as I step back further and say what we\\'ve committed to for our long-term more, which I think is very important compared to 2019 is we have a business that is larger on the top line and the bottom line and growing faster the top line and the bottom line than it did in 2019. And that, I think, is the overall commitment that we\\'ve made that we\\'re very convinced will stick to that I think will help drive your thinking about the overall model.\\n\\nAlex Brignall -- Redburn Partners -- Analyst\\n\\nSo I guess, it\\'s crucial to think of the additional businesses as incremental to your core business.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThat\\'s the last way to think about building the model out to look at our future EBITDA, yes.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citigroup. Your line is open.\\n\\nRon Josey -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nAnd really helpful to hear all the stats and see everything go as well this quarter. Glenn, I wanted to take you back maybe a year ago, we talked about growing bookings share of annual spend per customer. And as we see direct bookings increases to increase the connected trips rise, AI trip planners launch, just talk to us about the progress of just gaining share of that annual spend per customer. Any updated goals there?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo Ron, let me try understand the question. You\\'re saying the annual spend per customer, is that right?\\n\\nRon Josey -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nSo percentage share of travel spend. Yes. I think, we talked about getting like 25% a year ago or something.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes, right. So clearly, part of the issue is, is that our customers I\\'m happy about this, they don\\'t always use us. Sometimes they use a competitor. And we see that.\\n\\nWe see that unfortunately, more than I\\'d like. Part of it is not having a product that they want. That\\'s one thing, which we\\'re building out as we talked a little bit about. And the other thing is post things that there\\'s -- they go, for example, internationally, will go for this brand and by domestic on that one.\\n\\nThe key thing for us is to develop that loyalty that the reason that somebody really thinks that they will come to us for any travel will come to us. So part of it is bring all this together with the connected trip. Bring it all together with payment, developing the more we learn about the customer with their permission, of course, and then providing them with the -- what they may want more than anyone else. So they will always come back to us for all this.\\n\\nWhat do I believe in the end, it could be to I believe that in the end, we could have all customers all the time, of course not. But I hope that we can continue to improve this substantially in the long run. And we\\'ll see that as we get to finish off some of these areas, though, that we\\'re still building out. things like making sure we have enough of those alternative accommodations from people, so he wants it, we actually have one.\\n\\nIt\\'s like making sure that we have the payment product that they want to use, a payment system that many things around the world we\\'ve talked about, they don\\'t use Visa card. They don\\'t use Mastercard. They don\\'t use medicine space. They got other ways they want to pay.\\n\\nMake sure we have that payment for them, so that traveler customer tos comfortable using us. And I can go on and on and on with many other things. That\\'s what we need to do. And how high do I think can be? I\\'m not going to guess at it.\\n\\nI just know it could be substantially better than we are right now.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Wedbush. Your line is open.\\n\\nScott Devitt -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nI had two, please. The first one, I\\'m just wondering, Glenn, in terms of anything you can speak to in terms of shift in travel trends. There\\'s been a lot of discussion around shoulder month travel, April, May, August, September because of remote work and elevated prices. When I hear you guys talk about the months, I don\\'t necessarily see that in what you\\'re saying, but it may be related to comps.\\n\\nI\\'d just love to hear your perspective on shoulder month travel first. And then, secondly, now that there\\'s a new loyalty program in the market, I was just wondering your thoughts on Genius and how you\\'re thinking of the current offering relative to competing programs now in the market?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure. So yes, it used to be easy. There\\'s a shoulder and there was a peak and life was easy to understand, and that\\'s how it used to be, and it\\'s not like that at all. And boy, are things confusing right now when you have Omicron circling the world and some areas is hitting.\\n\\nAnd then, a year later, that\\'s the area to comp against. So it gets very, very confusing. As David was pointing out in the numbers how something could look something but actually it\\'s much more understandable they had COVID in that area last year or they just opened up last year. Here\\'s the thing.\\n\\nI hope that next year, things have turned back to a more normalized ease understanding what the seasonality of travel is However, there\\'s a new thing this come in, and that is the idea of people not going to offices as much and then they\\'re also traveling more. So they\\'re using this Monday and Friday where they\\'re traveling more for these longer weekends, etc., or perhaps a whole week, etc. And I think that\\'s going to make a more uncertainty see what that is. What that may end up doing is evening out travel throughout the year more where people are able to use time in areas that used to be shoulder season, but now people are using more, which help spread out the travel more.\\n\\nI don\\'t know. But we\\'ll find out. That\\'s why the -- I can\\'t change any of that. So I\\'m not going to worry about it too much.\\n\\nWhat we use is in the near term is what signals we see in terms of how much we should spend on marketing or not. And in the long run, what we hope is to continue to improve the products because that\\'s the way in the long run to win. That\\'s how we do it. I\\'m sure lots of you are going to have lots of guesses about what the seasonality trends are gonna be for the next couple of years globally.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to try and do that. You had another question, I believe, I forgot it, though.\\n\\nScott Devitt -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nJust Genius, and your thoughts on Genius for the computing product now in the market.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. So back to when American Airlines came out with our first loyalty plan. I\\'m actually old enough to when I actually joined it. All the way to now, there are lots of different loyalty plans for all different things and beyond travel for sure.\\n\\nAnd that another company comes out with a new one, whatever, that\\'s nice, interesting, but the truth is I love what we\\'re doing on Genius. I think, it\\'s a great pod, and we\\'re going to do even more with it. One of the things that\\'s really wonderful about is that we use it with our partners together in a way to give benefit to both of us, making sure that it is actually incrementally improving what\\'s good for that partner, along with, of course, being so good for our customer traveler doing that is the way of any type of loyalty program should really work. And that\\'s something that I think we\\'ve done a good job within, and we can do it now.\\n\\nWe need to gain on more benefits and any more benefit that enable the supplier to give more opportunity to merchandise and give things that will be good for the traveler, so they can win that actual transaction. And that\\'s something we\\'re going to continue to do. We\\'ve talked about how we\\'ve improved it from where it just started out, and now we\\'re up to three tiers. And there are lots of things down the road that will add on as we continue to develop the connected trip that will give us opportunity to give more benefit -- incremental benefits to both sides.\\n\\nI really don\\'t worry too much about what somebody else is doing a more concern, making sure we\\'re executing right on the things that\\'s important for our customers who are both the travelers and the suppliers.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nI will now turn the call back over to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, I\\'d like to thank everybody for participating. We are very, very pleased with the results you had. So I want to thank the partners, of course, our customers our dedicated employees and, of course, our shareholders. We appreciate everybody\\'s support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company.\\n\\nThank you very much, and good night.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator signoff]\\n\\nDuration: 0 minutes\\n\\nCall participants:\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nLloyd Walmsley -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nMark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nJustin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\n\\nKevin Kopelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\\n\\nDoug Anmuth -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nLee Horowitz -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\n\\nEric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\n\\nJed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nAlex Brignall -- Redburn Partners -- Analyst\\n\\nRon Josey -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nScott Devitt -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nMore BKNG analysis\\n\\nAll earnings call transcripts',\n",
       "  \"When Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel is worried about the future, he looks at what he calls his “smoke signals.”\\n\\nAre travelers booking hotels with fewer stars in their ratings? Are they staying fewer nights, or shifting to less expensive destinations? Trends in any of those directions might portend darker days ahead for the travel industry.\\n\\n“I do not see that yet,” Fogel said Thursday evening in a call with financial analysts to discuss the company’s second quarter earnings. “I do not see that in any of those areas.”\\n\\nInstead of a dark haze blotting his horizon, Fogel is seeing rainbows.\\n\\nGross travel bookings came in at a record $39.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 15% from the same period last year and, more notably, topping the $39.4 billion reported in the first quarter this year, which had been the company’s previous high.\\n\\nThose figures helped drive total revenues to $5.5 billion, a year-over-year increase of 27%, and net income to $1.3 billion, which rose 51% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion, 64% higher than last year and significantly higher than the company’s expectations, Fogel said.\\n\\n“In the second quarter we continued to see robust leisure travel demand, which helped drive the strong results we are announcing today,” he said.\\n\\nGet a dose of digital travel in your inbox each day Subscribe to our newsletter below Submit I accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy\\n\\nSome of the other numbers: Marketing expenses for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 4% from last year. And the number of booked room nights went up 9% year over year.\\n\\nBut the signals were even better. Looking at what happened in the first month of the new quarter, Fogel saw growth rates that more than doubled Q2’s 9% rise.\\n\\n“We estimate July room nights will increase about 20% year over year,” he said, later calling it a sign of what the company expects could be “a record summer travel season.”\\n\\n“Overall, we have been very pleased to see our strong performance in the first half of the year, which has benefited from the continued strength and resiliency of overall travel demand,” Fogel said. “Our solid start to the year combined with what we currently believe will be a new, all-time high for Q3 summer travel period results in an improved outlook for the full year.”\\n\\nBeyond celebrating the numbers, Fogel also spoke to the company’s investments in things like artificial intelligence and connected trips.\\n\\n“We’re seeing progress and momentum across several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long term,” he said. “These initiatives include advancing our connected trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, continuing to grow alternative accommodations and building more direct relationships with our travel bookers.”\\n\\nThe vision of travelers using a Booking Holdings brand to plan, book and enjoy their travels – as if carrying a travel agent in their pockets, Fogel suggested – is a long-held ambition. He sees it simplifying things for travelers, while giving suppliers more opportunities to personalize and merchandize their offerings – binding both more closely to the Booking Holdings platforms.\\n\\n“Over time, you will see incremental improvement and enhancements to our platform that move us another step forward to this long-term vision,” he said. “Importantly, this approach allows us to enjoy the benefits while we’re building toward that future state.”\\n\\nA key piece to solving that puzzle is AI. Fogel referenced a couple of initiatives that further the company’s goals.\\n\\nIn June, Priceline unveiled a suite of more than 40 new tools and updates for travel planning and booking, including an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot built on technology from both OpenAI and Google. “Penny” is the name for the new chatbot that is part of Priceline’s “Trip Intelligence” suite.\\n\\nAlso in June, Booking.com added conversational chat capabilities to its mobile app. The new AI Trip Planner combines the online travel agency's existing machine learning systems with OpenAI’s ChatGPT application programming interface so users can receive travel recommendations based on preferences they describe in natural language.\\n\\n“We believe the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating to travelers than it should be,” Fogel said. “Eventually, our connected trip vision will greatly improve it via technology.”\",\n",

On a constant-currency basis, first-quarter gross bookings growth was even stronger at 52% year over year.\\n\\nBoth room night and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the continued strength in leisure travel demand and from a lengthening booking window, particularly in Europe and the U.S. The room night and gross bookings outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future periods, which is when the revenue will be recognized. As a result of this timing difference, revenue was approximately in line with our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was a bit below given the additional marketing expenses associated with the future states. When we look at room night growth versus 2019, we have seen a slight increase in April compared with what we saw in the first quarter.\\n\\nFind out why Booking Holdings is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now Our analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market.

Overall, we remain encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand so far this year, which speaks to consumers' strong desires to travel. We currently see very strong growth of bookings received for travel during our peak summer period in quarter 3. Though we note, these bookings represent a modest percentage of what will likely be booked for total summer travel and most of these bookings are cancelable.\\n\\nWhile travel booking trends have remained robust, we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the path of the global economy. However, we believe we are well positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty given our highly variable expense structure, solid operating results, substantial liquidity, and strong free cash flow. This allows us to remain focused on what's important for the long term, which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our business while remaining cost-conscious and implementing initiatives across the business to drive cost efficiency. We continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities, including our long-term Connected Trip vision.\\n\\nThe Connected Trip is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. Our payments platform at Booking.com ties into our Connected Trip vision as payments helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Those still small today, we are seeing an increase in the mix of transactions that are connected to another book travel component in a trip. We believe continuing to build on this progress will improve the booking experience for more of our customers, which we believe will help drive increasing customer engagement with our platform.\\n\\nWe continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com, which provides consumers with another place to book an air ticket. Booking.com's flight offering was an important part of our total Q1 73% year-over-year increase in air tickets, which was an acceleration from the year-over-year growth in Q4 of 61%. We will continue this important work to provide travelers with the best possible flight booking experience. Though AI has received significant attention recently, we began our investments in AI years ago.\\n\\nWe believe then, and we continue to believe now that we can build a more compelling and differentiated offering if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience, a Connected Trip that would be more responsive to a booker's needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. We believe we are well positioned in this area, given that we have been using AI extensively for years in order to optimize interactions with our customers who are both travelers and partners. This goes from personalizing interactions and recommendations to machine translation in over 40 languages and dialects to analyze in the content, the pictures provided by customers and partners, to optimizing value for our customers, and many, many more. Over the years, we have built a strong team of AI experts across the company, and we keep current with the latest AI research through Booking.com's collaborations with universities.\\n\\nThis enables us to quickly react, adapt and learn how our traveler customers and supplier partners can benefit from new developments in the field. We are always looking for new ways to make customer interaction smoother and richer, realizing our ambition to make it easier for everyone to experience the world and to deliver our Connected Trip vision. Much of the recent attention has been on large language models or LLM, which provide a multitude of interesting possibilities for improving all areas of travel searching, booking, and experiencing. Two interesting possibilities are interactive itinerary building and answering travelers' questions.\\n\\nThough there are current challenges given current LLM sometimes produce inaccurate outputs. Nevertheless, we are excited to be exploring how we can make use of these technologies for the benefit of our customers. Some of our brands, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are experimenting regenerative AI plug-ins, while others are building ways to integrate the technology into their own offerings. It is, as we all know, very early days, but I am confident in our company's ability to benefit from these developments and improve our products for our customers given our experience in AI, our travel-related data, and our human and financial capital, our strategic priorities, including the Connected Trip vision and to improve the experience for our customers and drive more value and benefits to them.\\n\\nBut it's important to note that when we think about customers, we have two equally important customer groups to consider: our supply partners and our travelers. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, from traditional hotels to the vacation rental on the beach, to everything in between. We believe we can add value to these partners across the spectrum of accommodation types by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. In the area of alternative accommodations, we are seeing encouraging progress at Booking.com with alternative combination of room nights in the first quarter, increasing about 45% year over year and representing about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights, which is two percentage points higher than in Q1 2022.\\n\\nIn the U.S., our mix of alternative accommodation room nights, while still low relative to our global mix, has increased meaningfully in the first quarter, reaching highest level ever, and was also our absolute highest room nights in U.S. alternative accommodations ever. We are seeing continued momentum in terms of supply growth, both globally and in the U.S. for alternative accommodations, with global listings reaching about 6.7 million by the end of the first quarter, which is about 2% higher than year-end 2022.\\n\\nWe have seen great traction with the adoption of our enhanced payment solution for alternative accommodation partners in the U.S. We believe rolling out this solution along with other product enhancements last year, including partner liability insurance and an enhanced damage policy is helping to bring more professional supply online to our platform. In addition, we are seeing our alternative accommodation properties across our major regions, achieving improvements in productivity and our new partners are receiving their first booking on our platform earlier. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product offering to our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S.\\n\\nFor our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend, and direct relationships over time. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms in the first quarter continued to increase and reached the highest first-quarter level ever. We see a very high level of direct bookings from the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Just over 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the first quarter, which is a few percentage points higher than in Q1 2022.\\n\\nWe will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we are seeing here. Another way that we build a better experience and deliver value to our travelers is going through our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com. Simplicity is a core principle of Genius where our travelers get the benefits from the program right away. Over time, we've enhanced these benefits, including the creation of a top-tier level of Genius, and we will continue to find ways to deliver incremental value to our travelers through this program.\\n\\nFinally, we published our 2022 sustainability report last month, which provides an update on the progress we have made against the goals laid out in our climate action plan. We are proud of the emissions reductions achieved and ambitious targets set out for our business. But as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We're addressing this opportunity through our work with our Travel Sustainable badge program, which now includes over 400,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com, and that program has been expanded to Priceline, Agoda, and KAYAK.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by the continued strength of travel demand we are seeing so far this year, as well as our team's execution against our key strategic priorities. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers, both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter, as well as our thoughts for Q2 and for the year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful.\\n\\nInformation regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Before getting into details for Q1, I want to remind you that our business is quite seasonal. Q1 is typically a strong booking quarter, and we incur marketing expenses in Q1 for many bookings that will stay in future quarters, which is when the revenue is recognized.\\n\\nQ1 has also historically been our seasonally smaller revenue quarter and adjusted EBITDA quarter. This means that Q1 adjusted EBITDA can be quite sensitive to the level of bookings we get in the quarter. With the increasing mix of payments at Booking.com, Q1 is also becoming a strong cash flow quarter due to high level of bookings. So, now let me go on to our numbers for the first quarter.\\n\\nWe were encouraged to see strong year-over-year room night growth of 38% in the first quarter, which is better than our expectations. For the first quarter, Asia was up 100%. Europe and rest of world were both up more than 30%. We continue to see growth in the U.S., which was up high single digits versus the prior year.\\n\\nOur growth in total room nights versus 2019 increased from 10% in Q4 to 26% in Q1. In the first quarter, U.S. was up more than 30%, and all other regions were up about 25% versus 2019. The booking windows -- our Booking.com expanded versus 2019 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, driven by Europe and the U.S.\\n\\nThe booking window in the first quarter was longer than we expected due to strong levels of bookings for travel in the summer period. I note that many of these bookings are cancelable. Our mobile apps represented over 45% of our total room nights in the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel.\\n\\nThe direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of 2022. The international mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 53%, which was the highest quarterly mix since 2019 but still a couple of percentage points below Q1 2019. Our cancellation rates in the first quarter were below Q1 2022 and Q1 2019. For our alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our Q1 room night growth rate was about 45% year on year, and the global mix alternative accommodation room nights was about 33% which was higher than about 31% in Q1 2022.\\n\\nWe are pleased with the progress we made in North America alternative accommodations where growth in the first quarter was much stronger than the global average. Q1 gross bookings increased 44% year over year or 52% on a constant-currency basis. The 44% increase in gross bookings was six percentage points higher than the 38% room night increase due to 9% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple of points from strong flight booking growth, partially offset by the eight percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Accommodation in constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by about five percentage points from regional mix due to Asia room nights growing the fastest of all our regions and U.S.\\n\\ngrowing the slowest. Excluding regional mix, constant-currency ADRs were up about 14 percentage points year on year due to rate increases in all of our regions. Despite the higher ADRs in the first quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely.\\n\\nAirline tickets booked in the first quarter were up about 73% year over year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the first quarter was up 40% year on year or about 47% on a constant-currency basis. Although we had stronger-than-expected Q1 from a room night and gross booking point of view, the outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future quarters. As a result, we did not see revenue benefit in Q1 from these incremental bookings.\\n\\nThe lower-than-expected take rate in Q1 was entirely driven by the timing effects. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 32% year over year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q1 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business.\\n\\nMarketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 was about 20 basis points lower than last year, which is better than our expectations of being slightly higher. Relative to our expectations, this was due to better ROIs in our paid channels, as well as phasing of merchandising spend, which is tied to revenues. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 15 basis points compared with last year, which was better than our expectations. About 45% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from about 34% in Q1 2022.\\n\\nOur more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 25% year on year, which was higher than our expectations due to a few factors that impacted personnel and indirect taxes. The 25% year-over-year growth excludes $39 million in accruals related to potential settlements of indirect tax matters recorded in G&A. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $586 million in the quarter, which was up 89% year over year and would have been up 111% on a constant-currency basis.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA was lower than our expectations, impacted by marketing expenses incurred for the higher-than-expected gross bookings for stage in future quarters. February and March bookings came in stronger than we expected at the time of our prior guidance. These extra bookings also negatively impacted our take rate more than expected for the quarter. If we look at marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 to eliminate the timing difference, this was lower than our expectations and lower than both Q1 2022 and Q1 2019.\\n\\nNon-GAAP net income of $440 million resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.60 per share, which was up 197% year on year. Our average share count in the first quarter was 8% below Q1 2022 and 16% below Q1 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $266 million in the quarter. As a reminder, every profit metric we highlighted in this quarterly earnings report includes the negative impact of stock-based compensation expense because we view SBC expense at a very real cost of doing business.\\n\\nWe continue to manage SBC very carefully, and it continues to be a very low percentage of our operating cash flow. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of $15.3 billion was up slightly versus our Q4 ending balance of $15.2 billion. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 70% year on year.\\n\\nAnd our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, up 77% year on year. The operating and free cash flow generated in the quarter benefited from $2.3 billion in change in working capital due to an increase in our deferred merchant booking balance, as well as the $586 million in adjusted EBITDA. The $2.8 billion of free cash flow was mostly offset by about $2 billion in share repurchase in Q1 and the payment of about $500 million for debt to mature in March. Now, on to our thoughts for the second quarter of 2023.\\n\\nIn April, we continued to see strong demand with room night growth versus 2019 that was slightly higher than the 26% growth saw in the first quarter, with all of our major regions growing at similar rates. The booking window in April at Booking.com continues to be long as it was in 2019. On a year-on-year basis, April room night growth was in the mid-teens, which is lower than Q1 due to a more difficult prior year comparison. You will recall that last year, Q1 room nights were 9% below 2019, and April was up 10%.\\n\\nApril 2022 was our first month of growth versus 2019 since the onset of the pandemic. Our comments on the second quarter make the assumption that room night growth will be up mid-single digits year over year. As you'll recall, Q1 last year was impacted by Omicron. And in Q2, we saw a strong recovery, which resulted in Q2 2022 being our highest growth quarter versus 2019, especially May and June, which were our highest growth months last year.\\n\\nCompared with 2019, we'd expect future room night growth in 2023 to be just over 20%, assuming some moderation from growth from the first quarter in April when room nights were helped by more bookings we expected for the summer. We expect Q2 gross bookings to grow about four points faster room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and slightly higher constant currency ADRs. We expect Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be approximately 120 basis points above last year due to a less negative impact from timing and increased revenue from payments, partially offset by an increased investment in merchandising and a higher mix of flights. We may see less of an increase in our take rate if booking trends exceed our expectations, especially in the high percentage of these bookings offer stays in future quarters.\\n\\nThis could also result in higher-than-expected marketing expense in the quarter. We expect Q2 marketing expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year due to an increase in direct mix. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 to be about in line with last year. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than last year due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorel.\\n\\nWe expect our more fixed expenses in Q2 to grow about 25% year over year due to higher personnel and related expenses, indirect taxes, and IT expenses. Taking all this into account, we'd expect future adjusted EBITDA to be around 35% higher than last year. In terms of our outlook for the year, we are not updating our previous full-year commentary at this time. Our strong bookings in the first four months of the year created the potential for some upside but we want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary.\\n\\nWe continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margin will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we're pleased with our Q1 results and the very strong growth in bookings for the summer. We'll now move to Q&A, and Rob, could you please open the lines?\\n\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open.\\n\\nJustin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat, thanks for taking my question. I guess two things. First, when you look at ROI in the marketing channels, how do you feel about that going into the summer? Are you seeing some advantages based on changes from some of your competitors? And then secondly, as you think about your overall use of cash, any reason why you can't just put buybacks to work for the next five years? Are there anything we should be thinking about on the debt side? Thank you.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, Justin, why don't I take the second? And then I'll let David talk specifically about ROIs and marketing and thoughts on that going forward. So, I think we've been fairly clear in the past about how we view the company and how we believe our free cash flow should be used. And the first thing we always want to see is how can we invest that money appropriately in the company, build out services in ways that we can make the way we work with our partners and our traveler customers in a better way to help build this franchise. That's the first thing absolutely important.\\n\\nAnd after that, we say, well, we can't build it organically. Is there something outside the company, we think, that could add value make things better for both, again, our traveler customers and our partner customers? And the last thing is, OK, if we don't see a good use of that, then we should be somehow returning that capital to our shareholders, which is what we laid out the last quarter, we laid out our buyback program, where we had $4 million left in the previous authorization, $20 billion in the next one, that made $24 billion total. And then we said that over the next four years, we expect to be able to complete the full authorization. And I believe we've given out some numbers about our buyback now.\\n\\nAnd I am thrilled with the way we're doing this. But for long term, five years, this is what we laid out. Things can always change, but that's the way we've laid it out. And I'll leave it up to David, in terms of ROIs, anything you're seeing differently about the summer? I have myself.\\n\\nMaybe you've seen something.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Justin, I think it's hard to predict what's going to happen to ROIs that far out. So, what I will say is that you can see that we saw some encouraging ROI trends compared to expectations in the first quarter. Those were a little bit related to what happened to our bookings profile.\\n\\nSo, as we mentioned, we got a lot of extra bookings for the summer in the first quarter, more than we would have expected. The ROIs in the pay channels were better than expected due to basically three things: higher ADR, a lower cancellation rate, and longer-than-expected average length of stay. So, we were bidding -- so basically, that was tied to the expansion of the booking window. So, the expansion -- the booking window is quite close to correlate to what we saw in terms of good ROI performance in the first quarter.\\n\\nI've just always maintained the point these are highly competitive channels, many players in them, and relative to your question on competitive dynamic and nothing really to talk about is different.\\n\\nJustin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you. I appreciate it.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore. Your line is open.\\n\\nMark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. I just want to ask about the Asia Pacific travel and China travel. Are you already seeing the impact of China outbound travel? And then within Asia Pacific, it sounds like that's the strongest region. Are there any particular markets that are performing well for you? Thank you.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Mark, sorry about that. Let me take that part two ways because I know last time, I believe you asked about China outbound then, too, if I recall correctly. And so, China is not a significant part at all of our very strong Asia growth in the first quarter. And I want to make it clear that China is still not anywhere near it was in 2019 and outbound.\\n\\nIt is coming back in terms of overall market coming back, but there's still shortages of lift there. It is getting better than it was in January when there was a think mid-teens number of available airlift out of China outbound is coming back. I'll be probably honest with you, we are seeing more growth, obviously, in other parts of Asia. We're very pleased with the very strong growth we're seeing.\\n\\nI don't believe that we're going to break down individual countries, but I do see that this is an area of growth for us that I'm very pleased about. Anything else, Mark?\\n\\nMark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nNo, that's it, Glenn. Thank you.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Your line is open.\\n\\nLloyd Walmsley -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nAll right. Thanks. Two if I can. First, just going back to the higher marketing ROI.\\n\\nLike how much of that is you all proactively managing to higher targets versus just the competitive market, maybe softening up in marketing channels, and like do you think this is durable? And do you think we should think of this as a reflection of kind of normalizing consumer demand? And then the second one is just anything you're seeing in terms of just price consciousness among consumers either trading down at all or taking shorter trips to compensate for higher ADRs. Anything you'd call out there in any of your big markets.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nLet me take the second one because I do look at that very carefully to see are there any smoke signals coming out of the market, giving us any indication of any changes. And I have not seen any decline in the star ratings that people are going for nor are we seeing a decrease in the length of stays, either one of which could increase that potential softening in the market, and we have not seen that yet. And I think we made the remark about the booking window has gone out further indicating confidence, I believe, that's one hypothesis I want to point out, confidence about the future willing to put your money down and be willing to book for further out, so that could be seized upon. And what I've seen, too, is that people are concerned there's not going to be enough availability or they could be considered that prices are going to continue to rise, they will lock it in now, that's another way to look at, too.\\n\\nBut none of those hypotheses to say anything about a weakness at all. And in terms of I think your first question, I'll leave it to David.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. In terms of -- Lloyd, let me just remind you that this is a year that we still expect to be leaning into marketing and merchandising because we believe there's recovery in the travel market available to us. And I think that our growth rates relative to the market demonstrates that we're making progress there. If you remember, we started off the year by saying we expect our marketing and merchandising investment to be roughly the same as it was as a percentage of gross bookings, same as it was in 2022, we still expect that to be the case.\\n\\nRemember, we said that 2022 was a year which we look out of leaning in and making more investment relative to gross bookings that we did in 2019. And that story for us hasn't changed. We believe that we want to continue to lean in this year to continue to gain share in a recovery marketplace. And the fact that we saw some improvement in Q1, as I mentioned in my -- in the answer to my question to Justin, what to do with the kind of shape of our booking profile and the booking window and getting more summer bookings with higher transaction values than we would expect it to get from a mix point of view in Q1 and actually why the ROIs came in better.\\n\\nBut we still plan to believe in the industry. And as I said in Q2 and for the full year, we still expect that investment in marketing and merchandising to be as it was in 2022.\\n\\nLloyd Walmsley -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. All right. Thanks, guys.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrian Nowak -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat, thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the direct mix of traffic, the percentage of the business that's direct. You've made a lot of progress on that over the last year or so, a couple of years, Glenn.\\n\\nIf you break it down by region, where have you made the most progress in increasing the percentage of the business that's direct? And how should we think about how high that is? And what are the regions that you have the most runway to sort of drive that percentage of the business that's direct up longer? And then the second one on your forecasting. You guys have a lot of data and you're very good at forecasting. It seems like demand really came through better than you thought throughout the quarter. Which regions sort of drove that outsized demand versus your forecasting? Thanks.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAll right. So, we don't break down the direct mix by region at all. But I can repeat things I've said in the past about how important direct mix is to the long-term increase the value of the franchise because of things we talk about with our Connected Trip. They're getting people in through the app primarily, having them understand all the different things we'll be able to offer to them, give them a real personalized thing that will make them want to always come back to us.\\n\\nThe more we learn about them, the more they come back to us. So, it's a flywheel effect happening there. Again, I won't break it down by region, but my goal is to have every region have as many people as possible using the app and coming directly. That's the first thing.\\n\\nIn terms of how we varied against our forecast, I don't know how much. David, why don't you get into that?\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYou can see that -- obviously, we did significantly better on the top line. And I think the place to go to -- I'd say it was fairly balanced across all regions. Obviously, the place we sold on booking window expand the most was in U.S. and Europe.\\n\\nSo, that's where we got a higher share of summer bookings than we expected to get in Q1. But you see also Asia did very well. And in general, also exceeded our expectations, but we didn't have the booking window phenomena there. So, I wouldn't call out any particular region, but I will call out some of the differences in what we saw across the regions that contributed to the overachievement.\\n\\nBrian Nowak -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you both.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\n\\nDouglas Anmuth -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks so much for taking the question. Glenn, I just wanted to revisit on AI. Can you just talk about some of the advantages that booking would have in leveraging generative AI versus what other external or potentially new travel services might provide? And do you feel the need to protect the data on your platform to keep it from being used for training broadly across many large language models? Thanks.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, Doug, and a very interesting question about that, and I'll break it out into -- you start off with AI, then we went to a specific subset of degenerative AI. Let's just talk in general about AI first and how important this is into our business for many, many, many years, more than a decade perhaps, a machine learning model that really helped us do a better job making sure that what we're presenting to consumer, for example, is really something that they have a higher percentage chance they're going to convert on that. All sorts of ways that we use, very sophisticated machine learning models in many parts of the business that have helped us get us where we are today. Then, of course, we come out in the fold, something that is -- the somewhat a lot of people were not that aware of this generative AI, large language models and see what could be done with them.\\n\\nAnd clearly, anytime there's a major shift in technology, everyone thinks like, well, is this going to be disruptive to the players who are already doing well? Is it not? And I said in my prepared remarks, how I feel very confident of where we are in this because of the work we've done in AI in the past, the number of people we've had working on, the amount of capital we have, our collaborations with universities. I believe that we are going to be benefiting greatly from this new type of technology in many different areas and some we haven't any thought of them yet and some things are going to be easy, perhaps increasing the productivity of our developers, which we believe is hopefully going to achieve some very good results in the hopefully not so distant future, to things that perhaps are further away, but ways that people interact with us in that Connected Trip vision, a way that you really do are able to recreate that human travel agent into something that's actually an automated player, but that does so much better than the human being did in the past. Now, in terms of your very important question about the data and how do we protect it and not litigate it out and be used by others, that is a very important thing. And everyone from our attorneys to people in our development departments, people who are really working with some of these large language model foundational model people, we are looking very closely.\\n\\nHave they already been using our data, and should they be -- and I think there's going to be a lot of interesting regulations in this area that nobody knows the answer yet, too, but how will people become and say -- if they're data has been used in the past for training purposes or not. And I think it's a very open question that nobody knows the answer to yet, but we will be very interested in the results.\\n\\nDouglas Anmuth -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you, Glenn.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\\n\\nKevin Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you so much. Yeah. First question, I wanted to ask about ADR's big area of interest. With all the strength you're seeing in Q1, could you just -- and quarter to date, can you touch on how ADRs have trended generally compared to what you're seeing as of the last call.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSo, when we gave you some data on the call, I mean, ADRs are still trending positively. They're up on a year-on-year basis, and they're up across all regions on a year-on-year basis. So, we're not seeing any slowdown in ADRs. And when we -- we've been looking at some of the things, I'm sure, behind your question, but we're not seeing a reduction in ADRs in any region on a year-on-year basis or on a year-on-four-year basis.\\n\\nSo, we see ADRs continue to hold very strongly.\\n\\nKevin Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. And then one other question. Could you talk about a little bit about the dynamics in the U.S. market? What are you seeing in the U.S.\\n\\nthat's causing your growth to be a little bit slower there? And how do you feel about your market share in the U.S.?\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nWe feel that, obviously, our U.S. business is still growing very, very strongly compared to 2019. And we have -- seeing that growth relative to 2019 come down a little bit. But we feel that a part -- we still feel it's -- when you look at how our business is vis-a-vis 2019 is significantly bigger than it was before, and it's still growing at a very healthy rate vis-a-vis 2019.\\n\\nSo, we don't really worry about that.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I would just add, my conversations with our partner, some of our biggest partners, and with their senior management, the critical thing for me is, are we providing them with what they need? Are we providing incremental business to them that helps them do better in their business? And do you feel that we are valuable to what you need? And I only heard positive things from all the people that I speak to in regards to where we are today versus where we were in the past. And it's a much more complementary relationship, and I believe that will help us in the future to continue to build on that.\\n\\nKevin Kopelman -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks, Glenn. Thanks, David.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\\n\\nLee Horowitz -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Maybe sticking with some of the comments around direct. You guys continue to post impressive direct booking results and app growth. Maybe looking beyond this year, how does this price of execution within the direct channel inform the way you see margin progression beyond 2023? And then maybe one on VR.\\n\\nOur trends continue to indicate that you guys seem to be picking up some share in the U.S. vacation rental market, an area where you've been perhaps underrepresented. I guess what do you owe maybe some of the improvements you're seeing within the U.S. VR industry? And then looking forward, what are the things you think you can you need to continue to do in order to really scale up that business in line with some of your competitors?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo, why don't I start, Lee -- going to start with -- as you put it out, VR, vacation rental -- I'd like to use alternative accommodation. Neither one is a great customer-friendly term, of course. Let me talk about that, and then I'll let David talk about the direct business of what that may or may not indicate when you go into the share in terms of margins down the road. And I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks about some of the things we are doing in terms of the alternative accommodations area in the U.S.\\n\\nto build that business, and you were very polite to say that maybe -- that we may under-index where we said, it's very nice to say because I continue to admit that in the past, we have not been hitting that, as well as we showed that we were behind where I thought we should be, especially since we do fairly well in that in other parts world, particularly in Europe. Things that we've been doing are things that I talk about, first of all, is you got to make sure you're providing a good service to the people who own the home, who own the apartments. Are we doing things like liability insurance? Well, now we have something like that, damage waiver-type stuff. So, we have that.\\n\\nYes, we do. Last time I talked about how we were testing out an ability to request to book because some people or properties, they don't want to have automatic booking. They want to have a request to book system, so we are developing out back. Once you start getting that in, you had start saying, well, are people aware of your product? Because as I said, there wasn't a lot of -- people didn't have a lot of knowledge that we had such a product.\\n\\nAnd I was just to joke that if you went down in New York City and you said something on the street and said, I need a place in the Hamptons, where shall I go, I could almost guarantee you they weren't going to say Booking.com. Well, we need to get that supplies once we have it, then we got to make people aware that we have the supplies. We have to build all that. So, there's nothing miracle about this.\\n\\nThis is blocking-and-tackling business 101. Get your supply out there, make it attractive, and then make sure people know about it, and that's what we've been doing, cranking away at it. And I'm pleased, and I said it's really nice to see us starting to hit it. It can come up with their mix in the U.S.\\n\\nat all-time high in terms of alternative accommodation in part of our total mix, along with having absolute number of alternative accommodation room night bookings. So, I am pleased with the progress that we're making, and I know that we had to continue that because I know customers like this product, and this is an area where we have growth possibilities. And David, regarding direct, I'll leave it up to you on that.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. Direct mix obviously is very tied to our strategy. Our strategy is to build a better product, provide better service for our customers and partners and get those customers to come back to us more frequently and more directly after we've acquired them in the first place to which shall we bring them into the portfolio the first time around. So, it really does tie to executing against our strategy and lots of things that we do, many things that we do contribute to that better product.\\n\\nI could talk about alternative accommodation, I can talk about payments, we can talk about adding flights to all these things just create a better service for our customer, and therefore, we're more likely to get them back directly. So, it's very much tied to our strategy. It is also tied to your financial model because we made the comment last quarter on February, that we're obviously not targeting pre-COVID margin level because of the mix shift in the business for some of these new areas that we're now focused in but we do expect to be able to grow our EBITDA margin above the levels we're at in 2023 and the biggest driver, that would be continue to increase our direct mix. We'd also expect to be able to do better from a leverage on our more fixed costs going forward.\\n\\nAnd those themselves would kind of more than offset the pressure from the mix of lower-margin businesses as they grow within our portfolio. So, continuing to improve our direct mix is very important for both the strategy and the financial model and will be the major sources to be able to provide some margin expansion beyond where we are this year.\\n\\nLee Horowitz -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\n\\nHelpful. Thank you both.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Your line is open.\\n\\nJohn Colantuoni -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. Hoping you could update us on your strategy in the U.S. market.\\n\\nYou've had a lot of success gaining share in recent years, but I'm curious if you could update us on your learning so far about sort of the return on investments and how that's informing your aspirations to continue pursuing that opportunity as aggressively as you have been? And second, you sort of characterized investing ahead of the travel recovery to gain share throughout 2021 and 2022. I'm curious if that's your strategy in the Asia Pacific region as that market recovers. And if you have any early reads on returns on that investment. Thanks.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSo, I'll start off by saying that I'm very pleased with how the strategy has been working out in the U.S. given our gain in share. As David mentioned, we have a bigger business than we did in 2019. It's been growing nicely.\\n\\nI really do think that it's achieving what we've been trying to accomplish, which is to not be the under-indexed player than we were in the past, and we're making good progress there. In terms of the absolute ROIs on these things, we don't break them out by region at all. But I will say that, obviously, we are very conscious of spending money the right way to get the right return. And we are -- came out of the business.\\n\\nPreviously, I was in China. I know how important is to make sure that you're getting your money's worth to where you're spending it and we are doing that. Now, I think it's just going forward strategy work and to see us continuing in the same thing. And in terms of Asia, it was not dissimilar that we want to make sure when people are going to start traveling, we don't want to wait until you're halfway down the track to get out of the gate.\\n\\nThat would not be the best move. Get out in front, be there when the traveler wants to start traveling, and providing them with what they want. And that, we've been doing, and we just talked a little bit about how we were very pleased with the first quarter for Asia growth. And I think, hopefully, it will continue the same way.\\n\\nJohn Colantuoni -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks so much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\\n\\nUnknown speaker\\n\\nGreat. Thank you. This is Zach on for Deepak. Just first on the fixed cost side.\\n\\nOnce you -- or I guess the first half is kind of tracking above the kind of 20% growth that you kind of outlined last quarter. And the 1Q to 2Q is also kind of sequentially stepping up a little bit here. Just curious on your thoughts on how we should think about the fixed cost growth kind of maybe sequentially kind of into the back half of the year and into next year. And then second on just the buybacks.\\n\\nI think 1Q came in this stronger than we were expecting. Just curious how we should think about kind of the puts and takes in terms of the cadence of buybacks through the rest of the year, is 1Q kind of a good run rate? Or how should we think of that?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nDavid, you're the owner of the P&L there, looking that you want to take on the cost.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nOn the cost side, yes, I mean, we talked about being 25% in the first quarter -- we talked about being 25% in the second quarter. So, obviously, that's going to put a little bit of pressure on our guidance for the full year. But what I'd say just generally, when you look at anything that's in the kind of full-year view, we've not updated our guidance, there are going to be some -- likely go to be some puts and takes for the full year at the line item level but we're not going to update that line item detail today other than just recommit that we'll have a margin expansion by a couple of points versus 2022. Remember, next year, we said that we do expect our fixed costs to grow more slowly next year than we expect them to grow this year, and that continues to be the case.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd regarding buybacks, I think we laid it out a little bit. You know what our plan is. You know what we're doing. And I'm not sure there's any more color I can give, and we're pleased with where we are.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nGreat. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\\n\\nUnknown speaker\\n\\nThis is Josh on for Jed. Thanks for taking our question. Just wondering if you can maybe speak to how recent improvements in payments is resonating with U.S. property managers and their opportunity to increase share.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, Josh. You know, payments is an important part of the business. I've talked in the past about how it's the glue that brings everything together, along with making it easier for both the customer traveler and for the partner. And I think the growth in the amount of our business going through payments is a good indicator that is working and being accepted well.\\n\\nCustomers have a choice, both the traveler and the partner. Both of them can choose to use the payments or not. The fact that it's going up to me would be proof positive that people are finding it useful. And I believe in the long run, it's very -- being very, very helpful as we continue to build out the Connected Trip further.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\\n\\nStephen Ju -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\n\\nAll right. Thank you. So, Glenn and David, your merchant booking dollars are now at parity with your agency dollars. So, just wondering how much of this is due to the ramp in air versus a more proactive choice the consumer may be making and their lodging product selections, to your point earlier, to alternative accommodations.\\n\\nAnd I guess doing more merchant and the rise in deferred merchant bookings there should improve your free cash flow generation. So, does this change your capital allocation plans a little bit? Thank you.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nOn the second question, no, the capital allocation plan that we talked about last quarter, that Glenn summarized earlier, anticipated that we would be continuing to increase our merchant mix. So, on that piece, there is no change. In terms of where is that merchant increase coming from, just to remind us all, it's really coming from a mix shift inside of Booking.com where we are moving from what used to be almost entirely an agency model now to a much more balanced model. That is the biggest change would be in accommodations.\\n\\nThat's still, by far, the biggest part of the business, although our flights grows, it's having an impact. But what's really driving the changes that you're seeing is the increase in merchant mix across our accommodations business, our Booking.com.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho. Your line is open.\\n\\nJames Lee -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat, thanks for taking my questions. Two here. Can you guys maybe give us an updated outlook on ADRs? I think previously, you talked about expectation being maybe flattish on constant currency for FY '23. And also, David, maybe you can remind us -- talk about some of the puts and takes on take rate for your expectation for 2023.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. We said that we expect our ADRs for the second quarter just to kind of continue the picture. We expect our ADRs for the second quarter to be up slightly on year basis. As I mentioned in one of my earlier answers, we're not out -- we're not updating every single line item on our full-year guidance.\\n\\nBut if they continue to hold at the current level, there may be a little bit of upside compared to what we said on the last call on ADRs. As I said, there'll be some puts and takes up and down our full set of guidance. But we're not specifically updating our guidance or giving you anything beyond what we're talking about for Q2. We'll have to wait and see how that all develops.\\n\\nBut I think you can see from where we were in Q1, plus what we're expecting in Q2, things are trending positively.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Your line is open.\\n\\nRichard Clarke -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just the first question was what is the ability for you to continue to get discounts from your hotels? I know the Genius discounts tend to be hotel-funded. And in this travel environment, are they more or less likely to give those? And is that influencing your level of merchandising at all? And could that change if the travel environment altered toward the back half?\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nRichard, look, there's no doubt that hotels, when they are doing well, may see less of a need to use all other ways to distribute and get business, then just have to come to them direct, right? And one of the things they're always looking at is what's the return. So, with us in Genius, it's really being very targeted with them to make sure they understand how we can get the incremental demand that they wouldn't necessarily be able to get otherwise, and then working with them and make sure is this value for them or not. And something I actually talked a bit in the past, I'm not sure on a call, but our salespeople have worked with hoteliers and talk to them sometimes, well, we're working with Genius program -- the Genius program in or that it's not actually the best use of their money in the best way for the business and told them, look, don't think you should use Genius this way, this amount, this time, whatever other time, etc. This is an idea long term, having a good partnership.\\n\\nIt's not just knocking down the door of hotel, give us discuss, give us discount. That's not how this works. This works with science. This starts with data.\\n\\nThis is the machine-learning stuff I talked about in the past. This is getting together to come up with a way that we can come up with a better way to improve their business. Now, no doubt, as travel improves and such, there's going to be less of a need as the hotels will find other ways and perhaps less expensive ways or more efficient ways for them. And so, maybe there will be some places, but I am not at all concerned if your point is that this is going to make a drastic difference to how we do our business in the future.\\n\\nI don't see it. I see this as something that's going up more and more central as we continue to develop more ways to provide value to the traveler customer and be able to work with the customer/supplier partner in ways that are complementary, symbiotic for all of us that we all win in this, the traveler wins, the hotel wins, and we win.\\n\\nRichard Clarke -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Makes perfect sense. Maybe just a little technical question after. You talked about -- you've got $19 billion of merchant bookings in the quarter.\\n\\nYou've talked about longer booking windows, but your deferred merchant booking is only at $4.5 billion. Just trying to square the gap between the $19 billion and the $4.5 billion that we see there.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nRichard, you're confusing me on this one.\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nRichard, you stumped us both on that one.\\n\\nRichard Clarke -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nThe deferred merchant booking line, which is $4.5 billion on your balance sheet, how does that square with you getting $19 billion of bookings -- merchant bookings in the quarter that you're saying are largely for future quarters?\\n\\nDavid Goulden -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nRichard, why don't we follow up with you offline on that one rather than try and bog us all down? Just to understand the question, make sure we get you the answer. And if others want -- just to give us the answer, we can follow up to them as well. But we'll touch base with you offline. John will call you back.\\n\\nRichard Clarke -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Thank you. OK.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Glenn Fogel, I turn the call back over to you.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you. So, as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company.

       " datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 2, 0, 0): ['The third quarter of this year saw Booking Holdings achieve its highest quarterly revenue and adjusted EBITDA ever, the company reports.\\n\\nRevenue in the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2022, surged 29% year-on-year to $6.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA rose 26% year-on-year to $2.7 billion.\\n\\n“We took another important step in our company’s recovery from a profitability perspective,” Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel said in a conference call with investors. “Our Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA were 20% and 7% higher than Q3 2019.”\\n\\nBooking Holding’s net income for the quarter reached $1.7 billion – up 117% year-on-year.\\n\\nGross travel bookings in Q3 2022 climbed to $32.1 billion, an increase of 36% from the same quarter last year. Room nights booked rose 31% year-on-year. Marketing expenses for the quarter came in at $1.8 billion, up from $1.4 billion in Q3 2021.\\n\\n“I am encouraged by the strong results we’re reporting today and by the record level of travel during our peak summer season,” Fogel says. “In the third quarter, our customers booked 240 million room nights - a little under a quarter of a million room nights – which was 8% higher than in Q3 2019.”\\n\\nLooking ahead to Q4, gross bookings in October are up about 30%, driven by continuing recovery in Asia and slight improvements in Europe, the company says.\\n\\nDespite economic headwinds, the online travel giant hasn’t seen customers reduce the length of trips, according to Fogel.\\n\\n“Despite the rising concern around the macroeconomic environment, we are encouraged by the slight improvement in room night growth we have seen in October and by the level of bookings for travel in early 2023,” Fogel says.\\n\\nFor Booking.com, 60% of room nights were booked through mobile phones. Forty-five percent were booked through the company’s mobile app – a 10% increase over 2019. Fogel expects app bookings to increase.\\n\\nApp use is important because it gives Booking.com more opportunities to engage with travelers, he says. The key to steering mobile users away from browsers and to the app is to “provide a great experience, and they’ll come back and tell other people,” Fogel explains.\\n\\nThe company also plans to grow its Genius loyalty program and aims to have more competitive pricing. Forty percent of payments were made through Booking.com’s platform in Q3 – the highest quarterly rate ever, Fogel says. The platform has also seen an increase in supply of alternative accommodations.\\n\\nThere’s still too little awareness of Booking’s flights business, Fogel says, adding, “Our flight product is not yet as good as it should be. We’ll continue to improve upon in it.” In December of last year, Booking Holdings acquired ETraveli Group for €1.63 billion.'],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 23, 0, 0): ['Booking.com made headway in the U.S. while Expedia was likely distracted getting its internal house in order. Throw Hopper into the mix, and Booking will have to fight to solidify any inroads.\\n\\nBooking Holdings officials have spoken for years about their aim to take market share in rival Expedia Group’s stronghold, namely the U.S., and Booking appears to be delivering on that goal.\\n\\n“In the U.S., both our Priceline and Booking.com brands continue to execute well and contributed to U.S. room night growth of almost 30 percent and gross bookings growth of about 60 percent in 2022 versus 2019,” CEO Glenn Fogel said during Booking Holdings fourth quarter earnings call Thursday. “On our volume and consumer spend basis, we have grown our U.S. business to be meaningfully larger than it was prior to the pandemic.”\\n\\nWithout specifying the amount, Fogel said Booking gained market share in the U.S., and outpaced the broader accommodations market there. He said the U.S. gains came from brand marketing, adding flights to Booking.com, increasing adoption of the company’s payments platform, and working with “partners to ensure we are delivering incremental value to them.”\\n\\nHe said the company strives to access competitive rates from partners, such as hotels, and when it can’t Booking often discounts rates on its own to provide value to travelers.\\n\\nA Booking.com email promotion from February 23, 2023. Source: Booking.com\\n\\nBooking Holdings’ largest brand, Booking.com, is based in the Netherlands and has always seen Europe as its strongest market. It thought it could do better in the U.S., and is now starting to deliver on the effort.\\n\\nSluggish Competitors\\n\\nSpeaking about global competition, Fogel said Booking made inroads because competitors in 2021 “just didn’t seem to be out of the gate so fast in terms of their marketing, in terms of what they’re doing, whether it be brand or performance marketing in terms of trying to get the same demand that we are out getting there.”\\n\\nIn 2022, Booking went “full throttle” trying to gain customers through performance marketing in search engines, and increased its spending on brand marketing.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter, Booking saw its room nights jump 39 percent year over year. Net income increased 100 percent to $1.2 billion on revenue of $4 billion, a 36 percent jump compared with the fourth quarter of 2021.\\n\\nThe company notched $3.1 billion in net income for full-year 2022, outpacing the prior year by 162 percent. Booking Holdings generated $17.1 billion in revenue, a 56 percent year over year increase.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence ‘Hype’\\n\\nIn response to an analyst’s question, Fogel said there is a lot of hype about generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) at the moment.\\n\\n“I think we’re still probably in the peak of inflated expectations, but there’s no doubt this technology has seems to be accelerating all the time,” he said.\\n\\nFogel said he’s not scared about any competitive threats from generative AI, and is excited about it. He said the company has been working on AI for years, and will adapt to any far-reaching changes as it has done for the past 20 years, including the transition from desktop to mobile.\\n\\n“So I am confident in the future, and I am not scared, I’m actually encouraged by being able to use all of these new tools to provide a better service for both sides of the marketplace,” Fogel said.\\n\\nStrong Demand, Longer Booking Windows\\n\\nThe company is seeing strong demand and customers booking trips further in advance. Room nights booked in January 2023 hit 95 million, which surpassed the previous record set in May by more than 10 million. The 95 million room nights was 16 percent compared to January 2019.\\n\\nMuch has been said about how the length of booking windows — the span between when a traveler books a trip and actually takes it — greatly diminished during Covid.\\n\\nChief Financial Officer David Goulden said at Booking Holdings, the booking window for next summer has reverted to pre-Covid lengths, if not longer.\\n\\n“So summer bookings, yes,” Goulden said. “So we have seen, as I mentioned, the travel window the booking window recover completely on a global basis. But actually, the booking window has now expanded a little bit in Europe and North America and still slowly was — or shortly was, I would say, in Asia.”\\n\\n$1.2 Billion Gain on Meituan Investment\\n\\nGoulden said the company sold its investment in China’s Meituan in February and realized a $1.2 billion gain, which was 250 percent compared with its original investment. Booking still has a partnership in Meituan.\\n\\nFogel announced that Goulden would retire in early 2024. Goulden, who’s been chief financial officer since February 2018, will remain at the company for an additional two years after his retirement working on various projects, Fogel said.',\n",
       "  \"One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Booking Holdings Inc. ( ).\\n\\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\\n\\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\\n\\nThe formula for ROE is:\\n\\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\\n\\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Booking Holdings is:\\n\\n67% = US$2.4b ÷ US$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).\\n\\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.67.\\n\\nDoes Booking Holdings Have A Good Return On Equity?\\n\\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Booking Holdings has a better ROE than the average (23%) in the .\\n\\nThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.\\n\\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\\n\\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\\n\\nCombining Booking Holdings' Debt And Its 67% Return On Equity\\n\\nBooking Holdings clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.50. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\\n\\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this .\\n\\nOf course Booking Holdings may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this\\n\\nValuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

       " datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 10, 0, 0): ['What happened\\n\\nShares of online travel agent Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.13%) rallied 34% over the course of the first six months of 2023, according to numbers from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The big gain reflects a post-pandemic recovery in demand for leisure travel.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nMost investors knew it would happen sooner or later. By and large, though, most investors didn\\'t expect leisure travel demand to bounce back as well as it has this soon.\\n\\nThe latest layer of evidence to this end surfaced earlier this month. Using numbers supplied by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, Barron\\'s reports that Friday, June 30 was the nation\\'s busiest-ever day for domestic air travel, with nearly 2.9 million people boarding a plane somewhere in the United States.\\n\\nIt\\'s not just airlines seeing unprecedented demand, however. Carnival Corp. reports the total number of cruise reservations made during its recently ended second fiscal quarter also reached record levels, as did deposits toward future trips. In fact, as early as May The Wall Street Journal pointed out that several cruise lines were well overbooked, and being forced to bump passengers.\\n\\nDon\\'t look for this growing demand to abate anytime soon. The U.S. Travel Association\\'s most recent forecast suggests \"[domestic leisure travel] volume is expected to grow faster year-over-year than inflation-adjusted spending in 2024 and beyond.\" Inbound international travel is expected to grow by 31% this year and another 19% next year, finally reflecting a bounce-back in demand in other parts of the world.\\n\\nAnd Booking Holdings\\' results align with this industrywide data. Its first-quarter top line was up 40% year over year, with sales expected to grow nearly 21% for the entire fiscal year. Next year\\'s revenue growth is projected to cool to a pace of only 11%. With more scale and stability in place, however, analysts expect per-share earnings to swell from last year\\'s $99.83 to $137.84 this year to $162.36 per share next year.\\n\\nInvestors are simply connecting the dots. Not only are shares up 34% through the first half of the year, but they\\'re also up 65% from last year\\'s low.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nBooking Holdings stock is priced reasonably at 27 times its trailing earnings and less than 17 times next year\\'s expected bottom line. And there\\'s no doubt the demand tailwind it\\'s catching now has some life left to it, despite the prospect of economic turbulence ahead. The biggest risk to newcomers here is simply the scope of the recent rally. Other investors may be hesitant to buy it now, at the possible tail end of a run-up.\\n\\nOn balance, though, there\\'s still more potential long-term upside than there is risk in owning Booking Holdings.',\n",

This integration signifies a pivotal shift in how travelers interact with Booking Holdings' platform.\\n\\nKayak, for instance, introduced an AI-powered virtual travel assistant, driven by OpenAI's ChatGPT. This AI-powered assistant empowers users to engage in natural language conversations with the platform. The company says this tool transforms the traveler's booking experience, simplifying and personalizing the travel planning process. The strategic advantage for Booking Holdings here becomes evident by enhancing user experience and bolstering its overall competitiveness in a crowded booking market.\\n\\nBooking.com, another key component of the Booking Holdings portfolio, follows suit with its AI Trip Planner, which relies on OpenAI's ChatGPT API to introduce conversational elements into trip planning. Travelers can pose travel-related questions, receive tailored recommendations, and craft intricate itineraries. This move underscores Booking Holdings' dedication to employing generative AI to deliver user-centric, data-driven insights to enhance their travel experiences.\\n\\nIt isn't all ChatGPT. Booking Holdings' subsidiary, Priceline, joined forces with Google Cloud (part of Alphabet) to bring Google's powerful AI tools into play, allowing travelers to have natural conversations on that platform for trip planning as well. The partnership also simplifies customer service, helping agents navigate potentially tricky cancellations and rebooking rules with AI assistance.\\n\\nThis has the potential to add a new layer of service to Priceline bookings and cut down on potential labor expenses associated with complicated rebooking. The State of the Connected Consumer report from Salesforce shows around three out of five customers prefer to handle simple issues themselves, and slightly more expect immediate responses when they reach out to a company.\\n\\nGrasping the AI advantage\\n\\nThese initiatives go beyond simple research or development work, as they could become a major part of Booking Holdings' competitive edge. By embracing AI, Booking Holdings simplifies many of the regular hurdles of travel planning, making it more accessible and enjoyable for all users. This improved experience can translate into enhanced customer loyalty and, subsequently, higher revenue through bookings.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to a recent Salesforce snapshot research survey, approximately half of respondents said they have used generative AI. Around the same number also agree they would use the technology more if it were simpler to use or integrated in tools with which they were already familiar.\\n\\nAI-driven personalization can help build both customer loyalty and per-customer revenue, propelling consistent growth in metrics such as gross travel bookings, room nights booked, and total expenditures on each platform. Using a data-centric approach enables Booking Holdings to optimize user experiences, fostering brand loyalty while remaining conversational and accessible.\\n\\nChallenges and drawbacks of navigating the AI landscape\\n\\nWhile the integration of AI brings significant benefits, it also presents formidable challenges. AI-driven systems demand substantial investments in technology infrastructure and talent. Ensuring data privacy and security remains paramount, especially in an industry handling sensitive customer information.\\n\\nAI is not impervious to occasional glitches or misinterpretations of user queries, potentially negatively affecting the customer experience. Maintaining the delicate balance between automated assistance and human intervention poses a challenge. As AI adoption grows across the industry, competition intensifies. Rivals also exploring AI solutions could potentially erode Booking Holdings' competitive edge if not met with continuous innovation.\\n\\nBooking Holdings' resilience and potential\\n\\nBooking Holdings' foray into AI signifies more than a mere technological upgrade; it's a strategic maneuver to solidify its position as a travel industry leader. For investors, understanding this strategic adoption of AI provides valuable insights into Booking Holdings' growth potential and a dedication to delivering exceptional travel experiences that can drive consumer loyalty and growth.\\n\\nIn a world where technology and travel rely heavily upon one another, Booking Holdings' embrace of AI positions the company as an enticing investment option. While challenges exist, Booking Holdings' diversity of options and commitment to innovation make it a noteworthy player in the often turbulent travel landscape. Therefore investors keen on the long-term potential of AI-driven travel solutions may find Booking Holdings an attractive prospect.\"],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 20, 0, 0): ['Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.13%) dubs itself the \"world\\'s leading provider of online travel and related services.\" But the stock has frustrated investors in recent years, experiencing little net growth between 2018 and 2023. However, this year has seen a solid turnaround with the shares rising nearly 50% and reaching an all-time high above $3,250 per share in August.\\n\\nThere\\'s good reason to believe the internet and direct marketing retail stock could continue to climb higher over the long term. Here\\'s why.\\n\\nWhy Booking Holdings can grow\\n\\nAs the owner of Priceline, Kayak, Agoda, and numerous other travel sites, Booking Holdings has built an extensive ecosystem for travelers. This approach has brought more than 3.1 million properties into its ecosystem as of the second quarter of 2023. This is up from just over 2.5 million in the year-ago quarter. That includes hotels and resorts, apartments, homes, and other unique property types.\\n\\nIts growing property portfolio also places it into direct competition with not only archrival Expedia but also online travel company Airbnb. Also, it can draw a variety of customers seeking infinite options, regardless of whether they seek budget travel, luxury accommodations, or something in between.\\n\\nIndeed, the pandemic severely curtailed the ability to travel for billions of consumers and left the stock trading in a range for a time. But due to the size of the Booking Holdings ecosystem, it has positioned itself to meet this pent-up demand.\\n\\nAllied Market Research predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% through 2031 for the online travel industry. This would take the industry\\'s size to over $1.8 trillion. If true, Booking Holdings is only scratching the surface of its potential.\\n\\nBooking\\'s financials\\n\\nBooking Holdings earned $9.2 billion in revenue for the first half of the year, an increase of 32% compared with the same period in 2023. Additionally, these revenue increases outpaced the growth of expenses, allowing net income for the first six months of 2023 to rise to nearly $1.6 billion, up from just $157 million during the same period in 2022.\\n\\nFor the year, analysts forecast an 18% increase in revenue and a slowdown to 11% next year. Such lower growth rates could dampen expectations for the stock. However, the stock has earned impressive returns, far outpacing Expedia and matching the performance of Airbnb this year.\\n\\nFurthermore, thanks to its rising earnings, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is down from the beginning of the year. Currently, Booking Holdings sells for about 26 times earnings. Considering the rapid revenue and net income growth, this valuation makes the stock appear inexpensive despite this year\\'s performance.\\n\\nConsider Booking Holdings\\n\\nAfter years of failing to sustain growth, a bull market for Booking Holdings may have finally arrived. The rising stock price comes amid a rapid growth rate for the online travel industry. Moreover, after years of lockdowns preventing travel, Booking\\'s ecosystem can accommodate the pent-up demand for travel left over from the pandemic.\\n\\nWith rapid revenue growth, profits have rebounded significantly from year-ago levels. Such earnings increases place considerable downward pressure on the P/E ratio, a factor that should keep Booking Holdings stock flying higher.'],\n",

That's true even if there are doubts about travelers wanting to book their entire trip on one platform.\\n\\nEditor’s Note: Every Wednesday, Executive Editor and online travel rockstar Dennis Schaal will bring readers exclusive reporting and insight into the business of online travel and digital booking, and how this sector has an impact across the travel industry.\\n\\nOnline Travel This Week\\n\\nBooking Holdings has an answer to critics, who over the last few years mused that its best days were behind it, and that online travel agencies generally would be hard-pressed to rekindle the growth of yesteryear.\\n\\nIt was the business model, stupid.\\n\\nDavid Goulden, the Booking Holdings chief financial officer, said at an investor conference last month that the company’s business model was a major reason for its slowing growth leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020.\\n\\nAfter all, room night growth had progressively cooled from 28 percent year over year in 2016 to 11 percent in 2019. Gross bookings notched just 4 percent growth that year, and revenue’s uptick was a tad slower than that at 3.7 percent.\\n\\nGoulden pointed to flagship brand Booking.com’s pay at the hotel, or agency, business model as one of the culprits behind the sluggish pre-Covid growth. Today, Booking.com has transitioned to doing much more business on a merchant model basis where guests pre-pay for accommodations, and it has expanded into flights.\\n\\n“Booking.com, our biggest brand, we were almost entirely an accommodations focused business and entirely dependent upon the agency model where we did not touch customer money, right?,” Goulden said. “We basically made a booking, passed it on to the property partner and the booker, and the property partner managed the payment flow. Very scalable model, been very successful for us, but wasn’t quite as differentiated by the time we got to 2019 as it was in 2014. So that really explains the majority as to why things were slowing down.”\\n\\nFast forward to late 2022, and Booking.com processes 40 percent of its gross bookings through its home-grown payments platform. In other words, lots of guests pre-pay for their hotel and short-term rental stays, and Booking.com — and not the hotelier — handles the dinero.\\n\\n“We relied entirely upon what we got from our property partners to give us great rate because it’s still primarily what we do, but we couldn’t participate in those more targeted pricing promotional activities, and now we can,” Goulden said.\\n\\nToday, whether through its Genius loyalty program, which might tell members they unlocked a reward of $110 on their next accommodation booking or can “Get 10% back in Travel Credits,” Booking is actively engaged in merchandising, or peppering customers with various discount or cash back offers.\\n\\n“So we have said and continue to say that coming out of the Covid, we expect to grow faster than we did going into Covid, faster on the top line, faster on the bottom line and, of course, the two have a level of connectivity,” he said.\\n\\nIn addition to the business model tweak and an enhanced ability to merchandise, Booking has built a flights business, which is operating in more than 40 countries and is attracting new customers as part of the company’s “connected trip strategy.” Regulatory approval of Booking’s proposed acquisition of Sweden’s eTraveli Group, announced in late 2021, which would further enhance its push into flights, is still pending.\\n\\nAlso in the plus column, Booking.com bulked up on short-term rental inventory — which the company still archaically refers to as “alternative accommodations” — to give customers more choice and to solve new use cases in the current era of travel for leisure, business and just living.\\n\\nBooking’s overall strategy seems to be working. In contrast to sluggish gross booking, revenue and room night growth heading into 2020, in the third quarter of 2022, for example, Booking’s gross bookings (36 percent), revenue (29 percent) and room night growth (31 percent) leapfrogged year over year. Net income per diluted share soared 126 percent.\\n\\n“All the things that we’ve done give us many more levers to grow the business,” Goulden said. “And that’s why we believe that with the additional capabilities, the additional tools in the toolkit we didn’t have before in 2019 that we have increasingly will build upon more in the future. They give us many more levers to grow the business.”\\n\\nThe European Union reported this week that short-term rental bookings in Europe on Airbnb, Booking, Expedia Group and Tripadvisor increased 24 percent to 251 million room nights in the third quarter of 2022, compared with a year earlier, and this amounted to a 9 percent recovery from pre-pandemic 2019.\\n\\nNot that Booking Holdings is without major challenges, including its ability to build its brand and attract more direct traffic, whether its investments in the “connected trip” will pay off long-term (its success to date in flights and payments not withstanding), and concerns about a recession in 2023.\\n\\nIn Brief\\n\\nBig Banks Looking to Take Travel Market Share\\n\\nBanks such as JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, and Citi already have the customer base to appeal to travelers with attractive booking offers, cash back, and points, without having to ante up big for marketing like online travel agencies and hotels. Are the online travel agencies that power these banks becoming enablers of their own demise?

       " datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 21, 0, 0): ['Stock splits were all the rage on Wall Street last year, with companies like Alphabet, Amazon, and Shopify participating in the frenzy. As the stock market cooled off in the latter half of 2023, stock splits became quieter. Still, for some companies that trade at a high price, splitting their stock could make it more affordable to retail investors.\\n\\nBooking Holdings (BKNG 0.13%), the world\\'s largest online travel agency, is one company that could benefit from a stock split, as it trades for roughly $2,650 per share. Let\\'s explore what happens when a company splits its stock and whether Booking Holdings might do it.\\n\\nWhat\\'s a stock split?\\n\\nA stock split refers to the process in which a company increases the number of its outstanding shares while maintaining the same market capitalization. If a company decides to split the stock you own, the value of your investment will remain unaffected; only the number of shares will be adjusted.\\n\\nFor example, if you own 10 shares of a company at $100 per share, and the company splits its stock 2-for-1, then you will own 20 shares at $50 each.\\n\\nWhy would a company split its stock?\\n\\nWhen a stock, such as Booking Holdings, has a high trading price, it can become inaccessible to some potential buyers. Despite the availability of fractional shares through several brokerages, notable ones like Vanguard don\\'t offer this option.\\n\\nTheoretically, if a lower share price enables more investors to afford the stock, there could be an increased demand for the company\\'s shares, leading to a rise in a company\\'s market capitalization.\\n\\nA higher stock price can also hinder a company\\'s inclusion in a price-weighted index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That\\'s because the value of a price-weighted index is determined from an average of the share prices of all the companies. Therefore, a stock like Booking Holdings is unlikely to be added because its high share price would significantly outweigh others and dominate the index.\\n\\nWill Booking Holdings split its stock?\\n\\nAs a publicly traded company, Booking Holdings has undergone a single stock split, a 1-for-6 reverse split in 2003. In other words, for every six shares of Booking Holdings owned before the split, shareholders ended up with one share after the split.\\n\\nGoing forward, there is no assurance of a stock split for the company. Neither Glenn Fogel, the CEO of Booking Holdings, nor David Goulden, the CFO, have provided any comments on the possibility.\\n\\nIs Booking Holdings a buy ahead of a potential stock split?\\n\\nInvesting in a company based solely on the potential for a stock split is generally not recommended. The company\\'s financial performance holds far greater significance in determining a stock\\'s long-term prospects. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the recent business performance of Booking Holdings, as well as the guidance provided by its management, to make informed investment decisions.\\n\\nFirst, in 2022, Booking Holdings produced an adjusted EBITDA -- a metric used by management that shows a business\\'s ability to generate cash flow for its shareholders -- of $5.3 billion, representing an increase of 82% compared to 2021. The strong results continued into the first quarter of 2023, with the company generating $586 million, an increase of 89% from Q1 2022.\\n\\nSecond, management recently guided for second-quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be roughly 35% higher than last year. And better yet, it expects to produce \"a record level of EBITDA in 2023.\"\\n\\nIf Booking Holdings can hit or exceed management\\'s guidance, expect its stock, which has increased 32% over the past 12 months, to take flight in 2023 and beyond.'],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 9, 0, 0): [\"In some ways, Expedia Group's potential narrowing of the take rate gap with Booking Holdings has a lot to do with Booking's strategic decisions — pushing more into the U.S. and expanding its lower-margin flights business.\\n\\nThe traditional knock on Expedia Group in its matchup against rival Booking Holdings is that Booking has been way more profitable. And Booking can take those profits, plow them back into marketing, and win more market share.\\n\\nIn a research report last week entitled, “EXPE 101: A Deep Dive on the Business, Industry & Model,” Jake Fuller and Kevin Dolan of BTIG argued that Expedia is on the cusp of narrowing that profit gap.\\n\\nThe report looks at the profit question in terms of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin. In 2022, Expedia’s EBITDA margin was 11.9% versus 31.3% at Booking Holdings. BTIG said Expedia is on track to boost its margin to more than 23% in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe.\\n\\nThe Commission, Geography and Product Factors\\n\\nThe primary factor in the gap between the two companies’ EBITDA margins, BTIG said, is their respective take rates, or commissions and fees per booking.\\n\\nLooking at their respective take rates in pre-pandemic 2019, BTIG notes that Expedia’s was much lower than Booking’s (11% versus 16%), and BTIG attributed that to Expedia’s heavier U.S. focus, where hotel chain commissions are lower than in a more independent hotel-minded Europe, which is Booking.com’s core market. Booking.com is Booking Holdings’ largest business and its flagship brand. Other brands include Priceline.com, Kayak, Agoda and OpenTable.\\n\\nExpedia’s revenue in 2022 was heavily weighted toward lodging, as shown in this graphic from BTIG.\\n\\nThere is a historical irony to Booking having higher take rates than Expedia today. In the years after the Priceline Group, the former name of Booking Holdings, acquired Booking.com in 2005 and through around 2012, Booking.com took a ton of market share precisely because it was charging hotel commissions in the 10% neighborhood versus perhaps 20-30% for Expedia. That’s because Expedia was focused on the higher commission prepay hotel model while Booking.com solely did the lower-commission pay at the hotel model.\\n\\nToday, both companies offer both models.\\n\\nSince the pandemic, Expedia “reduced fixed costs while Booking is pushing into the U.S. and air, all of which should lead to a narrowing of the margin delta over time,” BTIG said.\\n\\nBooking.com, traditionally focused in Europe, has been making market share gains in the U.S., and has been focused on expanding its flights business — where commissions for large online travel agencies may be in the 2-3% range — after years of offering accommodations only, with their higher commissions.\\n\\nSo these are among the reasons the margin gap between the two companies is tightening, according to BTIG.\\n\\nA Bullish Assessment But Heavy Things on To-Do List\\n\\nExpedia Group’s share price closed at $110.48, on Friday. BTIG has a “buy” rating on the stock, and a price target of $150. That’s based on “high single-digit revenue growth,” Expedia’s EBITDA margin expanding to more than 23%, and potentially $2 billion in stock buybacks.\\n\\nThere are a couple of related things that could sidetrack Expedia Group in the short-term, however. After transitioning its Hotels.com brand to the Expedia.com tech platform in 2022 and seeing ample gross booking benefits, Expedia Group is in the midst of migrating vacation rental brand Vrbo to that same tech stack to gain efficiencies. That is a precursor to imminently launching a new loyalty program that unifies the previously separate Expedia and Hotels.com loyalty programs, and extends it to Vrbo for the first time.\\n\\nTech and product integrations can be tough and if any of these moves have glitches or become problematic, they might interfere with BTIG’s upbeat forecast for Expedia Group.\",\n",

       "  'As the dot-com bubble in the stock market was inflating, famous actor William Shatner put travel booking website Priceline.com on the map with a series of popular commercials. Priceline has since changed its name to Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.13%), and it\\'s performed marvelously for shareholders over the last 20 years, up more than 11,000%.\\n\\nWith references to the dot-com bubble and 20-year historical returns, you may feel Booking Holdings is past its prime. However, there is an important transformation happening at the company that could pave the way for a major innovation fueled by artificial intelligence (AI).\\n\\nWhy are payments important for Booking?\\n\\nTravelers can book trips directly with travel service providers like hotels and airlines. However, it often makes a lot of sense to go to a centralized party like Booking to compare various options. When travelers make a reservation on its platform, Booking generates revenue. In fact, most of the company\\'s revenue comes from travel reservations.\\n\\nFor years, Booking didn\\'t have its own payments system. Therefore, its revenue was based on commissions -- travelers ended up paying travel service providers directly, and Booking earned a commission when people actually took their trips.\\n\\nThis stands in contrast to a company like Airbnb, which handles its own payments. When travelers book through Airbnb, the company takes the payment, keeps a percentage for itself, and pays the host the difference.\\n\\nBooking\\'s business has evolved in this regard, and management is increasingly focused on growing payments on its platform. The results thus far have been promising.\\n\\nThe company divides revenue into different sources with merchant revenue representing reservations made with Booking\\'s own payments system. In 2019, just 25% of Booking\\'s revenue was merchant revenue. In 2022, this source had jumped to 42% of total revenue. And in the first quarter of 2023, merchant revenue grew 67% year over year to reach 46% of revenue.\\n\\nThere is a cash-flow benefit to growth in direct payments for Booking, which I won\\'t discuss here. But I will explain why growth of its payments platform is important to the big picture.\\n\\nBooking\\'s management has a long-term vision that it calls the \"connected trip.\" Basically, it wants to provide travelers with a one-stop, personalized travel service. But without a native payments platform, Booking\\'s users interact with multiple parties, which conflicts with the connected trip vision.\\n\\nGrowth in payments brings Booking one step closer to realizing its vision. And now, AI may provide the final boost necessary to get the company over the top.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the future AI innovation?\\n\\nIt can be hard to remember all the way back to life prior to online travel agencies (OTAs). But real-life travel agents did far more than just help you book your travel. They also helped you plan your trips. Booking and its rival OTAs help make travel reservations, but standard technology simply can\\'t provide personalization at scale efficiently.\\n\\nAI could change that. Booking CEO Glenn Fogel recently said, \"We can build a more compelling and differentiated offering if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience, a connected trip that would be more responsive to a booker\\'s needs and help manage different aspects of their trips.\"\\n\\nIf AI can help OTAs, then it\\'s likely that multiple companies will adopt the technology in some form. But with Booking, the connected trip vision is pretty interesting. And as the largest OTA, it has an extensive list of partner travel providers that could make its personalized travel services the very best.\\n\\nIn summary, growth in payments and the advent of AI could allow Booking to achieve its connected trip vision and make it the most compelling travel booking platform around. This could be a big opportunity for its business.\\n\\nWhat about Booking stock right now?\\n\\nNow, here\\'s the kicker: Even though Booking stock is currently hovering around an all-time high, its shares are about the cheapest they\\'ve ever been from a free-cash-flow perspective. The stock trades at just 14 times trailing free cash flow as the chart below shows.\\n\\nBooking has already proven itself as a long-term market-beating stock. Business is good, and shares are cheap, which means there\\'s little downside risk for those who invest today. But looking ahead, the business also has a potential catalyst with its connected trip vision, which means there could be solid upside.\\n\\nIt is that attractive risk-reward proposition that should convince investors to give Booking stock a hard look today.'],\n",

(“Booking”), a major travel reservation company, for engaging in false, misleading, or deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Booking falsely marketed hotel rooms at prices that were not available to the public as initially advertised.\\n\\nAcross its sites, Booking omitted mandatory fees from its initially advertised room rates, enticing consumers with artificially low room prices that were not available to them. In many cases, Booking also misled consumers by grouping and obscuring the mandatory fees with funds owed to the government as a component of the “Taxes and Fees” line item at checkout. Further, Booking’s actions put its honest competitors, who transparently display up-front the total price, at a disadvantage, causing many of them to lose customers to Booking. Booking, a Delaware for-profit corporation headquartered in Connecticut, operates nationwide under websites such as Booking.com, Priceline.com, and Kayak.com.\\n\\nThe lawsuit states: “For years, Booking has duped unsuspecting Texans who shop for room rates on its various websites by omitting mandatory fees from the advertised room rate. Booking’s failure to include these mandatory fees in its initial advertisement of room rates thwarts comparison shopping and, consequently, allows Booking to lure unwitting consumers with artificially low room prices that are unavailable at the rates advertised.”\\n\\nThe OAG has filed lawsuits this year against hotel companies deceiving customers about the price of rooms through obscured fees and falsely marketed prices.

The company’s travel-related offerings cover hotel rooms, airline tickets, rental cars, vacation packages, cruises, “things to do” at customer destinations and travel insurance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company has agreements with hotels, airlines companies, cruise ships, transport companies and vacation providers, which enable it to accept bookings on their behalf. Information on these offerings and customer reviews are available on the company’s owned or operated websites, thus helping customers take informed decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\nServices in the U.S. are provided through the Booking Holdings.com website. The company employs two marketing strategies in the U.S.—“price-disclosed” and “name your own price” or “opaque”.\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational revenues are generated through Booking.com and Agoda. Booking.com is older and therefore, has more patrons. Agoda is an Asian company acquired in 2007. Booking Holdings’s investment in Chinese travel company Ctrip facilitates the use of each other’s inventories in China and the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational results are comprised of revenues from rentalcars.com and Kayak. While rentalcars.com allows it to take rental car reservations, Kayak enables comparative shopping of Booking Holdings inventories. The acquisition of OpenTable that has allowed it to expand into restaurant reservations space, also contributes to the international revenues.\\n\\n\\n\\nBooking Holdings distributes its services through merchant (42.1% of 2022 total revenues) and agency channels (52.7% of 2022 revenues). It also generates around 5.2% of 2022 revenues through advertisements on its websites, classified as the Advertising & Other category.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe agency model is more lucrative for the company. It generates revenues from travel-related transactions which include travel reservation commissions, GDS reservation booking fees and certain travel insurance fees.\\n\\n\\n\\nMerchant model revenues are also derived from travel-related transactions which include ancillary fees, credit card processing rebates, customer processing fees along with the ones included in agency model.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertising & Other revenues are generated from KAYAK and Open Table.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Booking Holdings, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\\n\\nA $1000 investment made in March 2013 would be worth $3,759.29, or a 275.93% gain, as of March 22, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\\n\\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 gained 158.95% and the price of gold went up 15.96% over the same time frame.\\n\\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for BKNG.\\n\\nBooking Holdings reported fourth quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues grew year over year. Substantial improvement in its booking trends owing to growing travel demand was a tailwind. Further, the company experienced growth in rental car, airline ticket units and booked room nights, which was another positive. Strong growth across the agency, merchant, and advertising and other businesses contributed well. We expect growth across these businesses to continue in the days ahead. Our estimates suggest agency, merchant, and advertising and other revenues to see a year-over-year rise of 2.3%, 18.7% and 8.2%, respectively in 2023. Yet, headwinds related to the coronavirus pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to remain overhangs. Further, intensifying competition in the online travel booking space remains a concern.\\n\\nShares have gained 6.01% over the past four weeks and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

       "  'Airbnb (ABNB -1.20%) is a popular stock, and for good reason. Travel has become a top priority for many American households, and out-of-town vacationing is rising around the world, too -- especially in developing economies with a growing middle class. Airbnb still has great long-term potential.\\n\\nBut there could be an even better buy hiding in plain sight: Online travel giant Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.13%), parent company of Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, and Kayak. Here\\'s what you need to know.\\n\\nCan slower really mean mightier?\\n\\nDespite its popularity, some investors might be surprised to hear that Booking stock, not Airbnb, has been far and away the better performer over the last 12 months.\\n\\nFor one thing, Airbnb was working from a sky-high valuation that baked years of double-digit percentage expansion into the valuation this time a year ago. Booking, the \"sluggish\" internet giant with roots predating the dot-com bubble, did not. But that doesn\\'t mean big and slow is bad. In fact, while Airbnb\\'s revenue has increased a great deal more over the last few years, Booking\\'s revenue growth has been rebounding rapidly and has bested Airbnb in the last reported 12-month stretch. In the second quarter of 2023, Booking reported a 27% year-over-year increase in revenue to Airbnb\\'s 18%.\\n\\nBoth of these companies are cash-generating machines, and after many years of charting the path for a solid online booking accommodation business model, Booking continues to excel in this area. Booking\\'s Q2 2023 net income was $1.3 billion, up 51% from 2022 as the internet company continues to find new profit levers to pull. Net income per share was up 66%, up even more than straight net income thanks to Booking\\'s massive cash return to shareholders via stock buybacks. Management has repurchased $5.25 billion worth of stock so far this year, nearly $3 billion more than in the first half of 2022.\\n\\nIf you\\'re keeping score, smaller Airbnb did pretty well, too, scoring a 72% year-over-year increase in its net income as it still has a ways to go to catch up with Booking\\'s lofty operating profit margin.\\n\\nIs Booking stock the better buy?\\n\\nAs I said a few months ago, I believe Booking could be a timelier purchase than Airbnb right now. Booking trades for 19 times expected 2024 earnings, compared to 31 times expected earnings for Airbnb.\\n\\nBear in mind this is a premium valuation for both stocks, perhaps especially so for Booking. Over the long haul (five-plus years), Airbnb could have more growth potential as it expands into new areas of the travel industry beyond its core accommodations hosting platform. Booking is already well diversified. And 2023 is seeing record travel again for the U.S., but signs are emerging that Americans are starting to feel the pinch from inflation. Expect growth to slow in 2024.\\n\\nInterestingly, though, Booking management said on its earnings call that international room nights booked only just recovered to 2019 levels in Q2 2023. While overall travel spend should moderate going forward, world demand for vacations still has a long runway ahead of it.\\n\\nTo reiterate, Booking is no value stock. Expect some turbulence going forward, especially if travel demand does moderate. But if you\\'re looking for a great travel stock for the long haul, Booking Holdings could be a timelier buy than Airbnb right now.'],\n",

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\\n\\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Booking Holdings ( ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\\n\\nHow Fast Is Booking Holdings Growing?\\n\\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, Booking Holdings has grown EPS by 27% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.\\n\\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$249m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.\\n\\nIs Booking Holdings Worth Keeping An Eye On?\\n\\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Booking Holdings' strong EPS growth. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.

The deal has already passed regulatory muster in the UK.\\n\\n“Given the strategic importance of flights to our connected trip offering, we believe it is critical to bring Etraveli’s flight expertise and technology in-house while also unlocking some of the limitations that exist in our current commercial agreement,” Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel said earlier this year in discussing the Etraveli Group deal.\\n\\nNow it appears that the potential acquisition faces challenges, at the least, although perhaps Booking, which has already been under scrutiny by European regulators over its strengths in hotels, could make concessions to smooth things over.\\n\\nBooking Holdings’ U.S.-based Priceline unit offered flights from day one of its founding in 1997, but the parent company’s flagship Booking.com, which traces its origins to 1996, eschewed flights in favor of its core hotel offering until around four years ago. Booking.com introduced a flights tab at that time and passed off customers to sister brand Kayak for search results, but in 2019 it partnered with Etraveli to get Booking.com’s flights business off the ground in earnest.\\n\\nAs of May 2022, Booking.com was offering flights in around 40 countries.\\n\\nFogel said earlier this year flights is an essential part of his connected trip strategy to make travel more seamless. Not only does it bring travelers into the trip-planning process sooner than if they were starting with hotels or short-term rentals, but it is also attracting an influx of new customers, many of whom are booking flights on Booking.com, as well as accommodations.\\n\\nThe company said a few months ago that around 20 percent of travelers who book a flight on Booking.com are new customers.\\n\\nTo be sure, the Etraveli Group acquisition is not a make or break one for Booking Holdings, but if the European Commission blocks the deal outright, it would certainly be a setback for Fogel’s overall strategy. In such a scenario, Booking might have to stick with the limitations of partnerships to try to further develop its flights technology solo.\\n\\n“They do a lot of things that could we recreate on our own?,” Fogel asked rhetorically referring to Etraveli Group a few months after the deal announcement. “Probably, but it would take a long time, would require us to use resources that we want to use elsewhere. So by acquiring Etraveli, we’re going to bring that technology in-house and be able to do things that we couldn’t do when we were just a commercial partner.”\"],\n",

I mean, this is so much better than last year.\\n\\nSchaal: And look at the beautiful weather too. Let’s talk about the weather. There’s a lot going on. So on Monday, the European Commission blocked your $1.7 billion deal to buy Sweden’s eTraveli Group. They’re a flight technology and (online travel agency).\\n\\nCan we show a slide? This is a quote from you in 2022, “Given the strategic importance of flights to our connected trip offering, we believe it is critical to bring eTraveli’s flight expertise and technology in-house while also unlocking some of the limitations that exist in our current commercial agreement.” Critical, did I say that? Now, what, Glenn?\\n\\nFogel: It is extremely disappointing to me that the regulators decided to block this transaction. I absolutely believe they’re wrong on the facts, wrong on the law, and it’s wrong policy. That being said, for the business, we’ve had a relationship with eTraveli for many years and we recently extended that agreement for many more years. So we are going to continue to build out our flight business, which has been doing very, very well.\\n\\nThis is unfortunate in terms of it will not allow us as quickly and as easily to improve the flight product that we have right now. Therefore, that is bad for consumers. That is bad, particularly, for people who have been pleading for a better flight experience. Everyone here, we all fly. We all buy our tickets, many of us do it ourselves online and we know it’s not as easy as it should be. There are a lot of ways to improve it.\\n\\nNow, I can’t get into the minds of the people, the regulators in terms of what their thinking is. I can say a couple things that I know to be true, and these are, first of all, we are not a dominant player in travel in Europe. The numbers that I saw some of the regulars put out, I don’t know where they come from but they’re not right. I also know the fact that us doing a flight business certainly would help our hotel businesses. No doubt about that. And the regulator said one to 3%. That was their decision. And they say-\\n\\nSchaal: That’s a thing though. They claim that by doing the flight business, it’s going to make you more dominant in hotels.\\n\\nFogel: That was their basis, and they say it’s going to get better by 1 to 3%, therefore, you should not be able to improve the flight business. There’s so many things and we’re going to obviously appeal this. We’ll go to the courts, it will take time. I’m confident that my belief is the correct one. And I look back, and some of us who are old enough to remember, about 20 years ago, actually, more about 24 years ago, there were some air travel companies, tour operators in Europe and they want to do a merger. It’s called First Choice in Air Tours. They tried to do the merger, and the regulators, just like this, the EU Commission said, “Can’t do that, it’s bad.” They went to court.\\n\\nThree years later, court knocked it down, said the regulators are absolutely completely wrong. Of course, by then, it was three years later and I don’t see too much about Air Tours or First Choice anymore. This is a problem, when regulators make decisions that are incorrect, it impacts people negatively. It’s unfortunate but it is.\\n\\nSchaal: Fortunately, I can get into the minds of regulators. So they claim that you have more than 60% (online travel agency) market share in Europe, and they did a survey of 15,000 hotels, and overall, the conclusion was that the hoteliers were fearful that this would boost your hotel market share, that you could raise prices for hotels and possibly, consumers would end up paying higher hotel rates. What do you say to that?\\n\\nFogel: I say that a couple things, so first of all, let’s get this straight. So we have a relationship with Etraveli for many years, helping us to provide the backend to help us sell airline tickets. We go out, we buy the shares, the equity of eTraveli. We give the owners cash. Okay, done. Now, a hotelier says, “That could increase the costs of me doing business with you.”\\n\\nI don’t follow the relationship at all. We’re currently doing business with eTraveli. We’ll be doing the same business after we own the shares of eTraveli, how does that impact anything? Again, the logic makes no sense at all, but I certainly see, if I am a hotelier or someone and somebody asked me, listen, what do you think about somebody raising prices? And I would say, I’m against it. I’m against raising prices. So I would not trust polls or surveys as a way to come out and make very serious decisions for the good of an entire society.\\n\\nSchaal: Quick point though, the quote I just read said, “Acquiring them would help you unlock certain limitations in your partnership agreement.”\\n\\nFogel: Right now, when you’re working where you have a shareholder currently, who has certain objectives, and we have certain objectives, it’s easier instead of having to discuss these two objectives, which may not always come together and be able to have one person driving the train, but it is what it is, and we’ll work together and look, the good thing is our flight business has grown so rapidly over the last couple of years and I expect it to continue to do so. I’m just disappointed that we won’t be able to provide even better service to consumers. Hopefully, we go through the courts and hopefully, at some point down the road, there is a final decision.\\n\\nSchaal: Do you remember George Herbert Walker Bush, number 41?\\n\\nFogel: I do. I am that old. Yes.\\n\\nSchaal: He was campaigning and he said, “Read my lips, no new taxes. Are you ready to take the pledge? Read my lips, no higher commissions if this deal goes through.”\\n\\nFogel: So a couple things, I believe Mr. Bush did not get reelected.\\n\\nSchaal: You’re not running for anything.\\n\\nFogel: Probably a bad decision on his point to make that statement, came back and bit him. Here’s the thing, what should we charge a partner? Well, it’s not what we should charge, it’s to negotiate what can we charge. What is the market for a price? If we charge too much, nobody buys our service. It’s that simple. If I went to hotelier and I said, “We’d like to have 60%, 70% commission,” you know what they’d say, “Go away.” Or if I say, “How about 50? What about 40? What about 30?”\\n\\nSchaal: We’ll use Expedia.\\n\\nFogel: They look at the market and say, “I can use anybody.” And by the way, as we all know, and anybody who runs a hotel knows very well, you get to choose. You choose who you want to use and when you want to use them. It is not a surprising observation that when it is high season, third party distributors get fewer rooms than they do when it’s low season. And this is the thing, if somebody does not like… says, “You’re charging too much,” I would respond, “Okay, then perhaps you should use someone else. If we are not giving you value, don’t use our service.”\\n\\nI do the same thing with everyone else. By the way, there’s this company, google, you’ve heard of it. It’s a big company. You have to buy Edward, you got to put money in to get… but you get to choose how much to pay, like you bid. And then if you bid higher, maybe you’ll get more customers. If you don’t like the price, don’t use it. It’s that simple.\\n\\nSchaal: We could go on and on, on this topic, but let’s move to something else.\\n\\nFogel: Okay.\\n\\nSchaal: Well, something related. So if this deal does get blocked, so your whole career has been being involved in (mergers and acquisitions). You helped Priceline acquire the two companies that became Booking.com. You were very involved in buying Kayak, Agoda, OpenTable maybe. But if this deal gets blocked, it… It always depends on the type of deal, but it seems like you’re pretty much barred from buying anything substantial in Europe.\\n\\nFogel: It’s interesting in terms of what is the regulator’s viewpoint and is this a specific transaction that applies this or is what else does it apply out to? And by the way, why does this apply in other industries for other people who want to do transactions? And one might question, was this whole transaction not so much about us, but about the EU regulators trying to make a statement moving from what previously had been settled law and regulations of how (merger and acquisition) applies and trying to come up with new laws and new regulation without actually having to have a new law, just come up with a new rule.\\n\\nIt’s interesting because, and again, I can’t get into the minds of regulators, but I’m reading about the interesting things happening in the United States in regards to regulatory (merger and acquisition) issues. And there’ve been a lot of things put out by the current administration trying to stop a lot of mergers.\\n\\nAnd a lot of them have failed these efforts to try and create new rules that are not based on the current laws is failing in many places. And we’ll see how this new thing came out yesterday with Amazon, and we’ll see what that ends up or …. We’ll see because this really is coming to a new end. I don’t know how it’ll turn out. I do know this though. I know that we want to try and promote new products, new services that benefit society, and I sometimes think that sometimes people think that big is bad. Big is not necessarily bad. Big can be bad if it’s misusing what your powers and your abilities are, using things that are illegal or incorrect that you should not do.\\n\\nBut just because something is big, many times, that actually makes something good. And I’ll tell you, I love Amazon. It brings me my stuff. It comes right away. It’s cheap. And I love Booking.com because yes, we’re a bigger company than many, but there’s a lot of good things that are very helpful to both sides of the marketplace.\\n\\nSchaal: It looks like there might be some further roadblocks coming. So later this year, the reports is that Europe will designate Booking.com a gatekeeper. I love this quote that you gave to the Financial Times. I think you were talking about the regulatory environment and you said, “Every day, we have to fight to try and get bookings. If we don’t fight for the best for the consumers and our travel partner suppliers, that business will go somewhere else. It just takes one click.”\\n\\nFogel: I like that quote. Thank you. So-\\n\\nSchaal: It’s pretty tough business. I mean, you have your… Go ahead.\\n\\nFogel: I meet with regulators and I meet with government people all the time, and sometimes they start off with the, you’re very, very powerful and dominant. And I say privacy will prevent me from going and looking, but I’m just curious, do you do all your travel with us? You get these looks like, maybe not. And then you’re like, so tell me, do you feel you can only use us and there are no other ways to do it, you’re going to get a hotel? And you’re just, “Oh my God, I got to use Booking again. It’s horrible. I have no choices.”\\n\\nWe all know in this room and they know, that is not true. In fact, you’ve got data. I know you have data. How many times people look at different sites before they actually press by. I don’t remember the numbers you put out but they’re-\\n\\nSchaal: 28.7. No, a lot of sites. Dozens of sites.\\n\\nFogel: Dozens.\\n\\nSchaal: Yeah, I would say.\\n\\nFogel: Dozens of sites before you buy yet, yet somebody thinks that there’s some dominant position. Am I the only person who sees there’s a bit of a problem between those two things? That’s crazy. It’s like living in a kafkaesque world. It’s dominant, but yes, I do look at many other sites. Look, the reason people choose us, and that’s what I meant in the FD thing, they choose it because they believe that using us versus another one is giving them more value. Maybe it’s a better price, maybe it’s better customer service. Maybe it’s just easier to use.\\n\\nWhatever the reason is, people have choice, in this idea that somebody decides, well, I’m in charge and I’m going to say that you’re dominant and you are not going to be able to do things. That is not the way we should be doing our regulatory framework and not how we should be trying to improve our society.\\n\\nSchaal: Before we go to some audience questions, another topic about how we should not be doing things this way. What day is today? It’s Wednesday. On Friday, Saturday or Monday, whatever, we might have a government shutdown. What is that going to do to your business? What is that going to do to the travel industry? What’s your take?\\n\\nFogel: Well, it’s definitely not going to be good. Let’s start off with that one. We all know that. Depends on how long it goes for, and nobody really knows. And from reading the media, I’ve not seen anybody come out clearly with what some of the plans are in terms of how some of the government run things are going to be done or not.\\n\\nBut here’s some things we can be pretty certain of, the longer it goes, the worse it’ll be. The people who are critical workers for the government will still work, but they won’t get paid. I don’t know about you, but working without paying, not a good feeling. And if we look back the last time there was a government shutdown, at length, May, it was 2019, I think, about 18, 19, somewhere around there, people started not showing up for work as much. They started calling in sick.\\n\\nThat’s really bad for things like TSA. That’d be really bad for the air controllers in the tower. When do you stop flights? Flights shut down because there aren’t enough people in the tower. Well, we saw that already. Just a shortage in general. There’s a shortage of people in the tower. But imagine everybody starts saying, “You’re not paying me?” It’s been X amount of time. I’m feeling ill today, I’m not coming in. That’s really bad. And if you look back, and maybe it’s a coincidence, but when the number of people in the tower started going down significantly, all of a sudden, they got together with an agreement in Washington to keep it going.\\n\\nSo I would say that all of us here have a duty to make sure we are reaching out and talking to our representatives, and saying, “Hey, work it out and get it going.” We, in travel, took a tremendous hit from pandemic. Horrible. Now we’re up, things are finally going back up. Now we’re going to have another knockdown. It’s like a fighter gets off, the canvas gets up and you hit them in the jaw again. It’s crazy. I really wish because it’s so important that our lives are not being so disrupted because people can’t just have a standard, get together, have a negotiator, come out with something that works. I go to Washington, I feel like it’s like sports, and who wins? Who loses? But these are real people’s lives that they’re playing with.\\n\\nSchaal: Exactly. So speaking about that, so you have a fintech division, and part of that is to… You develop your own payment system. And there were recent headlines across Europe, Hungary, England, Japan, Brazil, that your short-term rental hosts weren’t getting paid for weeks and even months. Your office in Hungary was raided. What’s going on there? And that hurts the little people. The individual homeowner is just trying to pay their mortgage and get by.\\n\\nFogel: Yeah. We did a very, very large change in our backend financial systems. Some things didn’t work so well. You do everything you can to make sure it’s going to be perfect. Wasn’t. Some people didn’t get paid a very, very, very small percentage. But even one person is one too many.\\n\\nWe have two types of customers. We’ve got the travelers and we’ve got the partners. And if we don’t provide good service to them, that’s on us. We screw it up, and there were mistakes. And if you don’t pay a very large company so much, well, its cap, it’s not a big deal.\\n\\nBy the way, in our agency business where we get paid by the partner who sends us money afterwards our commission, sometimes we don’t get paid on time either. So 30 days late, 60 days late, 90 days late, and during the pandemic, we didn’t get paid at all. Happens. This is not a pandemic, this is a mistake. And the thing is, for the smaller partners, partners that were really depending on that payment, I just felt so horrible.\\n\\nSchaal: What kind of redress can you have for them?\\n\\nFogel: First thing is get their money as fast as you can, as fast as you can. And I’ll tell you, I get emails and I’ve read them and they are really heartbreaking. You just feel horrible when you do something wrong. And we have fixed it, it’s good now. But I’ll tell you, this is something where I say to the team, and I say that… I spoke out at a town hall, town hall for all of our 20 something thousand employees.\\n\\nAnd I told them about this. I said, “Look, this is not the way we want to be. We got to do better. We should not ever, ever feel that this is okay.” Well, it’s only a small number of partners. That’s the wrong attitude. It’s always got to be, every partner counts. So the lesson from it was we have to do better.\\n\\nSchaal: So here we are in New York City, they just effectively banned short-term rentals. You can only stay in a short-term rental, if the host is licensed, if you’re sharing the apartment with the host, no locks on the bedroom doors. What is your advice to the city of New York on their short-term rental policy?\\n\\nFogel: So this is a very complex situation. We have a bunch of things happening at once. We have many stakeholders going on. We have partners who want to be able to rent out their property. We have travelers who want to stay in it. And if let’s say it’s an apartment building, you have a bunch of other people who live on that floor. Maybe they don’t want to hear the wheelie suitcase every day coming in and out or whatever.\\n\\nSchaal: Or maybe they can’t find an affordable apartment to live in.\\n\\nFogel: Right, as well, of course, too, because it’s being rented out on a short-term basis. A lot of things happening at once. And then throw on top of that a place like Venice right now where they just put a new… they try and put in a tax because of over tourism where the city’s overwhelmed and some people who their homes and they can’t live there, so there’re too many tourists. And that is partly due to the short-term rental effectiveness. So lots of different stakeholders that we have to all deal with. What is the right thing and what’s the right way to do it?\\n\\nThe way New York City has done it is one way to do it. We obviously are discussing with them issues about it. It may have been too draconian. Maybe there are other ways instead of a blanket across, maybe there are better zoning that could do it, working out better for everybody. But every municipality that has a large influx of tourism, tourists, they’ve got to work these issues out because there are competing interests here.\\n\\nAnd sometimes people say, “well, how about just price? Why don’t we just put in a really big tourist tax on it?” But then only people who have more money could then visit. And maybe that’s not fair either. So I’m glad I’m not a politician, but I do believe we have a responsibility to participate and try and make sure this is what is the optimal solution for all the stakeholders.\\n\\nSchaal: Some interesting things going on with AI. You just rolled out a trip planning thing in your mobile app just to genius members in the US, I believe?\\n\\nFogel: Yeah.\\n\\nSchaal: And then I understand that you’re using it internally and you’ve already been able to replace some positions for manually translating things, and you’ve transferred those people, you didn’t lay them off, you transferred them into different jobs. But it seems it’s definitely coming, we’re going to start hearing this year, X company laid off this number of workers because of AI. So where is all this heading?\\n\\nFogel: Well, I think from the previous session, I mean, there’s incredible promise in AI that we all know, and I didn’t hear everything that was said, but also, there’s incredible risk, and there’s the risk you’re just pushing out the issue of, what happens to people’s jobs? Since the human being wasn’t in the caves, there’s been technology and it’s made things change different. And we look in history and we see these types of very, very rapid technological changes can be very disruptive to societies. And when you see what could potentially be very large disruption to jobs, that causes a lot of problems.\\n\\nSo yes, we love the fact that we have all these new technologies and generative AI is going to be just one of the most transformative new technologies that possibly you have to go back, I don’t know, being able to use fire, I mean, this thing is going to be enormous, but how are we going to handle the changes in society like people’s jobs being displaced? So for example, we are retraining, moving people into something else. Is that going to work for everybody? Probably not. So what’s going to happen there?\\n\\nExample, there are a few million people who make a living driving trucks in the US, now we all see, AI, it’s not generative AI, AI coming out and it’s going to automate trucking. What happens to these 3 million people? They’re very skilled in trucking. What are they going to do next? These are the issues. We have strikes right now in the UAW, part of the dispute, part of the issue is, what’s going to happen to their jobs as technology reduces their jobs, because now we want to have electric vehicles, a lot fewer parts in electric vehicles, a lot less jobs than that.\\n\\nSo that one too, or you have the people in the West Coast, the screenwriters, concern on the contract negotiations. One of them was about generative AI is going to create scripts. We all have to figure out, how is this going to do? But because we work in a competitive environment, we know that one of the things we have to do is cost-efficient, and it is less expensive to have AI or generative AI, any type of AI to do something. We’re going to be implementing it. And when we implement it, the way we’re saving money, potentially, could be because we don’t need that human being job, and it’s really concerning what happens to that human. And that’s something that I think our governments have to do a great deal thinking about how to deal with this in terms of retraining.\\n\\nI was in Washington two weeks ago, I guess, yeah, two weeks ago, when Majority Leader Schumer had one of his first of several informatory sessions with other senators about AI and how they’re going to call regulations in Europe. There’s AI regulations already being pushed through Japan. China already has some stuff out Brazil, all over the world. This is going to be very, very important for our path going forward. And I just hope we get it right because mistakes here could be very hard to correct. So I hope people are thoughtful as they come out with what these regulations are.\\n\\nSchaal: Got it. Switching gears, Expedia Group CEO, Peter Kern, will be in that chair in an hour and 15 minutes. He called your Agoda brand, “One of the worst rate abusers when it comes to violating raid parity and undercutting hotel rates.” And to that, you say?\\n\\nFogel: Did Peter really say that?\\n\\nSchaal: He really did. And that was a quote.\\n\\nFogel: Maybe he woke up on the wrong side of the bed that time.\\n\\nSchaal: You think that’s what it is?\\n\\nFogel: I don’t know.\\n\\nSchaal: I mean, there’s a lot of hotels that are pissed off about it, I’m sure.\\n\\nFogel: Again, here’s the thing is, we believe that being a good partner means following the rules with the partner and such. And I don’t disagree with partners if they say, look, I don’t like X, Y, Z, and I’m not going to do business with you anymore. Understood. It’s our job not to do the things that are ticking them off, et cetera. So I can only say that we will continue always to strive to do what is right for the partner. And I talk to Peter occasionally, I ask him, “Could you give me some examples? I’d like to know so I can fix what you’re saying we’re not doing right.”\\n\\nSchaal: Tell him to come clean.\\n\\nFogel: I’ll ask him. Look, here’s part of the issue too, it’s a very competitive market out there. And as we know, people don’t always know what the rules are with certain types of products, rates, et cetera. So some things can be sold incorrectly, not out of malice. But the price was there and you sold it. And believe me, I understand his point of how important it is that we do try and have rules, people following them and not… Let’s face it, you don’t like cheating in sports and you don’t like cheating in business.\\n\\nSchaal: Thanks, Glenn. We got to play by the rules. We’re out of time.\\n\\nFogel: Okay.\\n\\nSchaal: Thank you very much.\\n\\nFogel: Thank you very much.\"],\n",

In the face of high interest rates, a pileup of credit card debt, and widespread white-collar layoffs, consumers have begun cutting back their spending on just about everything. The one exception to this, it seems, is travel spend.\\n\\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), the parent company behind Booking.com, OpenTable, Priceline, and Agoda; and one of the largest OTAs (online travel agents) in the world, has been major beneficiary of the post-COVID resurgence in travel demand.

Speaking of Airbnb, now that both OTAs and Airbnb have been side by side in the market for years, we can see that there is room for both. Airbnb certainly has its uses and functions (larger homes for group trips, more localized stays in smaller towns); but so does staying in hotels (convenience of a check-in counter when needed, amenities like gyms and spas, proximity to city centers).

This conversion has helped Booking secure its long-term profitability and cash flow. Diversity of brands. With each of Booking\\'s key subsidiaries being individually well known (including OpenTable, which gives Booking exposure to the dining space as well), the company is well-positioned to grow long-term market share.\\n\\nStay long here: Booking is riding strong tailwinds, and investors still have plenty of rally left to go.\\n\\nQ4 download\\n\\nLet\\'s now review Booking\\'s latest quarterly results in greater detail to highlight the incredible strength that the company has experienced to date.\\n\\nBooking Q4 results (Booking Q4 earnings release)\\n\\nBooking\\'s revenue grew 36% y/y in its most recent quarter to $4.05 billion, beating Wall Street\\'s expectations of $3.90 billion (+31% y/y) by a huge five-point margin. Underneath this, note as well that merchant revenue grew 71% y/y and represented a high watermark of 44% of overall company revenue.\\n\\nThe chart below shows how Booking\\'s core bookings metrics have trended. Room nights, by far Booking\\'s largest source of gross bookings and revenue, accelerated to 40% y/y growth in Q4, versus just 32% y/y growth in Q3. Overall gross bookings in dollar terms, meanwhile, grew 44% y/y to $27.3 billion. There is a sharp FX headwind here; in constant-currency terms, bookings would have grown 58% y/y.\\n\\nBooking key metrics (Booking Q4 earnings release)\\n\\nBooking notes that room night trends have accelerated over FY19 as well (stripping out any impact of 2021 still being COVID-impacted). Per CEO Glenn Fogel\\'s remarks on the Q4 earnings call:\\n\\nRoom night growth versus 2019 of 10% in the fourth quarter improved from 8% growth in Q3. And for the first time, we saw room nights across four of our major regions above 2019 levels for the quarter, which was another important milestone for our recovery. Room night growth trends have further strengthened in 2023, with January room nights up 26% compared to 2019 or up about 60% year-over-year. We are very encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand last year and into the new year which speaks to consumers’ strong desire to travel. However, as we stated last year, month-on-month trends can be volatile and we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the future path of the world’s economy. And David will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and on the recent trends we have been seeing in 2023.\"\\n\\nFogel\\'s remark that January bookings have continued to accelerate versus Q4 is also quite promising - and may highlight the conservatism in Wall Street\\'s 17% y/y revenue growth estimate for 2023. And note that on top of room nights/units sold counts, pricing may be a tailwind in 2023 as hotel and travel operators take advantage of the inflationary environment and strong demand to raise prices.\\n\\nBooking has done a fantastic job converting strong top-line results into robust profitability. Q4 Adjusted EBITDA grew 32% y/y to $1.24 billion, representing 31% of overall revenue; full-year Adjusted EBITDA expanded 82% y/y to $5.30 billion, also a 31% margin and 450bps stronger than the prior year.\\n\\nBooking adjusted EBITDA (Booking Q4 earnings release)\\n\\nSimilarly, Booking\\'s free cash flow more than doubled this year to $6.19 billion (helped in no small part by the huge growth in merchant bookings), representing a 36% FCF margin - thirteen points better than in the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nBooking FCF (Booking Q4 earnings release)\\n\\nValuation and key takeaways\\n\\nAt current share prices near $2,700, Booking trades at a market cap of $101.32 billion. After we net off the $12.40 billion of cash and $12.50 billion of debt on the company\\'s most recent balance sheet, Booking\\'s resulting enterprise value is $101.42 billion.\\n\\nFor FY23, Wall Street consensus is calling for $20.1 billion in revenue (+17% y/y) and $130.35 in pro forma EPS (+31% y/y); for FY24, estimates are landing at $22.28 billion in revenue (+11% y/y) and $155.29 in pro forma EPS (+19% y/y)\\n\\nI think the best way to look at Booking\\'s valuation is on an FY24 P/E basis; and on that front, Booking\\'s 17x FY24 P/E looks reasonable, especially against an expected ~25% EPS CAGR over the next two years.\\n\\nStay long here and ride the upward wave.',\n",

It’s thus clear that Airbnb in 2022 expanded the mammoth edge in sales and marketing as a percent of revenue that it already had in 2021.\\n\\nSales and Marketing Spend as a Percent of Revenue 2021\\n\\nSales & Marketing Spend % of Revenue Airbnb $1.18 billion 19.8% Booking Holdings $4.68 billion 42.7% Expedia Group $4.22 billion 49.1%\\n\\nSource: Skift, Financial filings\\n\\nFor example, Booking Holdings’ sales and marketing spend as a percent of revenue was 4.75 percentage points higher than Airbnb’s in 2022 than the prior year; Expedia Group’s was 4.95 percentage points greater than Airbnb’s last year versus 2021.\\n\\nThese comparisons have their limitations; the three are very different companies, have strengths in different geographies, and have varied marketing goals. While Airbnb focuses on short-term rentals and does considerable marketing to attract new hosts, both Booking and Expedia market short-term rentals, but hotels and flights, as well.\\n\\nMarketing spend as a percentage of revenue isn’t the holy grail in companies’ performance and there are disagreements on approach, but it speaks to online travel agencies’ efficiencies and deficiencies in attracting customers who may not find them through free Google search results or go directly to their websites and apps when looking to travel.\\n\\nStill, Airbnb, which attracts customers through public relations, as well as brand and digital marketing on search engines, and elsewhere, repeatedly hammers home the point that it attracts around 90 percent of its traffic from unpaid search results and visitors who come direct. Hence the very small sales and marketing spend as a percent of revenue.\\n\\nAll three companies notched net income in 2022: Booking Holdings produced $3.1 billion, Airbnb generated its first full-year profit at $1.9 billion, and Expedia Group $352 million. Still, Airbnb had a higher adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) margin, a measure of profitability, in 2022: 34.6 percent for Airbnb versus 31 percent at Booking Holdings.\\n\\nHowever, the adjusted EBITDA figures are not readily comparable. Airbnb excludes stock-based compensation, which was $899 million in 2022, from its adjusted EBITDA figures while Booking Holdings included around $404 million of stock-based compensation and other payments that were stock-based. So Booking Holdings on a like for like basis had a 31 percent adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 compared with roughly 23 percent for Airbnb had it included the stock-based compensation it handed out.\\n\\nIn September 2022, which was prior to Airbnb reporting its 2022 net income, I asked Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel whether the online travel agency business model was broken because of the relatively high marketing spend.\\n\\nSchaal: OK. Let’s talk a little bit about your competition with Airbnb, on several levels. For example, in the second quarter, Airbnb spent 18 percent of its revenue on marketing. Booking Holdings, Expedia, Tripadvisor, MakeMyTrip, they all spent more than 50 percent of revenue on marketing. Is there something broken in the OTA business model? How do you look at that?\\n\\nFogel: Well, I look at the fact that… Let’s go for 2020, we made over a billion dollars EBITDA. I don’t remember everybody’s number, but I do believe it was a fairly negative number. Let’s go 2021. I think we made significantly … Did they [Airbnb] make money in 2021? I don’t think so.\\n\\nSchaal: I don’t think so.\\n\\nFogel: I don’t think so either. We made a lot of money, and I think if you look at the quarter most … I mean, broken? I don’t know. We should all be so broken.\\n\\nExpedia Group CEO Peter Kern inferred last month that company to company comparisons of sales and marketing spend as a percent of revenue can be misleading because of his company’s growing business-to-business partnerships, which come with a higher percentage of sales and marketing spend as a percent of revenue than consumer businesses.\\n\\nClarification: We updated this article to show that Booking Holdings would have had a higher adjusted EBITDA margin than Airbnb had Airbnb included stock-based compensation in this metric.\\n\\nIn Brief\\n\\nAirbnb CEO Mulls Launching Paid Listings\\n\\nExpanded paid offerings to Airbnb hosts and sponsored listings could be coming on Airbnb.

       "  \"JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nAirbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has been the new hot stock in the traveling industry for the last couple of years. The company is a true industry disruptor, with its platform focused on hosting, offering many different sorts of stays in the most abandoned or special locations. Airbnb offers a whole new experience to travelers and looks poised for impressive growth over the next decade as this type of traveling still looks like it is in its early days.\\n\\nYet, with Airbnb taking away all the attention, it sometimes seems like people are forgetting the true industry giant in Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG). This one is offering a similar opportunity to get exposure to the lucrative traveling industry, with a strong growth outlook, according to analysts, while having a much cheaper valuation compared to Airbnb. Booking has a much better international spread and is only behind Airbnb on the North American content based on market share. And while I am also very enthusiastic about Airbnb and its prospects, I feel like Booking Holdings might offer the better investment opportunity at this point, offering better potential returns.\\n\\nIf you have ever planned a vacation or a trip away from home, there is a big chance that you used, or at least checked, Booking.com as you looked for hotels or other forms of stays. Booking Holdings Inc. is the largest online travel conglomerate by both volume and revenue, and it has been for many years now. The company operates across 200 countries and has over 20,000 employees operating a platform available in over 40 languages. Besides owning flagship website Booking.com, Booking holdings also operates websites such as Priceline.com, Agoda.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights, Rentalcars.com, and Momondo. The company is a travel behemoth and has a market share of over 38% in online booking apps worldwide, with its main competitor being Airbnb, as shown below. Also, Booking.com is responsible for over 25% of all hotel bookings worldwide.\\n\\nBusiness of Apps\\n\\nYet, the company's position is not as strong as it has been, and when we look at online bookings in the U.S., the picture is less positive, with Booking Holdings only holding a 19.5% market share. This is primarily due to significant competition from industry disruptor Airbnb, which has now overtaken Booking in the U.S. with a market share of over 21%.\\n\\nIn addition to serious competition, Booking Holdings saw a steep drop in revenues as a result of the covid-19 pandemic during 2020 and 2021. With pretty much the whole Western world in lockdowns, demand for travel accommodation fell to decade lows and, therefore, also low demand for the services offered by Booking Holdings. Yet, the company quickly recovered after these dismal years and recently reported revenue of $17 billion for FY22, overtaking the $15 billion in revenue reported for FY19 - the last covid-free year.\\n\\nBooking Holdings revenue (Statista)\\n\\nWith the travel industry now nearly back to, or over, its 2019 levels, and Booking Holdings back to reporting record revenues, growth is also expected to return to more normalized levels. Still, this does not need to be bad news, as the travel accommodation industry is expected to keep growing at double digits over the next decade, while the total travel and tourism industry is also expected to keep growing going forward. With Booking still holding a significant market share globally and continuously expanding into new business segments such as experiences, it looks well-positioned for continued growth. Yet, with it acting in a highly competitive industry, it will be important for Booking to keep distinguishing itself from the competition.\\n\\nThat brings me to the big question: is Booking Holdings a good long-term buy at current prices? To determine this, I will dive into its latest earnings release, financials, valuation, outlook, and discuss growth drivers.\\n\\nLet's get to it!\\n\\nFY22 Review and growth drivers\\n\\nBooking Holdings (which I will refer to as Booking) reported its latest financial results for 4Q22 and FY22 back on February 23, 2023. A first look at the headline numbers shows a very strong performance with the company outperforming the analyst estimates. EPS came in at $24.74, beating the consensus by $2.66 and revenue of $4.05 billion managed to beat the consensus by $150 million. This represented an increase of 21% vs the same quarter in 2019 as the underlying accommodation take rate remained flat. This strong performance was due to an increase in room night growth of 10% from 2019 (used as a comparison as this was the last covid-free year) which was better than the 8% growth witnessed in the third quarter.\\n\\nThis improvement was driven by growth in both the U.S. and Asia. Room nights booked in the U.S. were up by more than 35% compared to 2019, for the fourth quarter in a row. Europe and Asia grew by mid-single digits and the rest of the world was up by 110%. Growth in Asia might not look over convincing, but this was the first quarter of positive growth since 2019 for this region as the fourth quarter saw the first slight improvement from covid-19 measures in China which is a huge traveling market.\\n\\nTo point out a few more important metrics for 4Q22, gross bookings increased by 32% compared to 2019 and the number of airline tickets booked in the platform increased by only 2.9%, yet this was up 61% compared to 2021 as Booking continues to expand its flight tickets offering through the platform.\\n\\nNow, with the reporting of the fourth quarter, Booking also discussed its FY22 results, which are much more meaningful with quite a bit of volatility in month-to-month trends, so let's shift our focus to this. Despite the tough economic circumstances over 2022, Booking reported a record high 900 million room nights booked on its platforms which was 6% higher compared to 2019, and a massive 52% increase from 2021, although this is somewhat meaningless with covid restrictions still very much ongoing in 2021. Gross bookings of $121 billion increased by 26% from 2019 levels and a massive 36% on constant currency.\\n\\nWith Booking deriving a lot of its revenues from international markets, the strengthening of the dollar during 2022 has had quite some impact on revenues, which explains the large difference mentioned above. Still, despite these headwinds, Booking reported a very solid 2022 as it managed to report very impressive growth rates vs. 2019, which shows that the company has fully recovered and is reaching new all-time highs across several metrics. It is achieving this despite the fact that not all regions were restriction-free during the full year, with Asia only opening up by the second half of the year. This makes the performance even more impressive and continues to offer tailwinds for the next couple of quarters as well.\\n\\nRevenue also reached an all-time high of $17.1 billion and was up 13% from 2019. This shows revenue growth was slower compared to gross booking growth, and this is reflected in revenue as a percentage of gross booking which was down from 2019 levels of 15.6% to 14.1% in 2022. According to management, this was the result of a 1% impact from bad timing, a 0.4% impact from a slow recovery of advertisement income, and a 0.3% impact from a negative mix in flights. All in all, this should not be a long-term trend and the percentage of revenue from gross bookings should return to 2019 levels, and over, over the next couple of quarters.\\n\\nWith the increase in revenue, Booking also improved its profitability and reported an EBITDA of $5.3 billion, up 6% compared to 2019 on constant currency, yet down 4% in dollars. The EBITDA margin came in at 31% and was up 4% from 2021. This all resulted in a net income of $4 billion and EPS of $99.83, which was up 118% YoY.\\n\\nIn addition to reporting very impressive financial results, Booking also made great strides in its strategic priorities which it laid out 2 years ago. One of these is increasing the payments made on the Booking.com platform as the shift from agent to merchant drives important benefits for all parties involved. This is what CEO Glenn Vogel said about this during the earnings call:\\n\\nFor our supplier partners, offering a payment solution adds value in several key ways, including providing access to additional traveler demand by enabling alternative payment methods, reducing cancellations, decreasing operational workloads and enabling fraud protection. For our travelers, Booking.com's platform allows many consumers to pay how they want to pay and we believe ultimately helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience.\\n\\nExperience and functionality are key to delivering the best service to both customers and supplier partners. Both factors can drive customer loyalty. If you like a platform and it works, you are much less likely to switch to another one, so this should help Booking maintain its incredible moat and large user and supplier base. I am, therefore, pleased to see that Booking is focusing on these matters, and even more that it looks like it's working. In the fourth quarter, Booking processed 42% of Booking.com's gross bookings, and management was very pleased with this progress.\\n\\nGross bookings of Booking Holdings worldwide from 2015 to 2022, by type (Statista)\\n\\nAnother strategic priority of management, focused on increasing the customer experience to improve loyalty, was building out connected trip capabilities. What this means is that Booking Holdings aims to improve the entire booking experience by making it easier, more enjoyable, more personal, and delivering better value. Booking aims to do this by focusing on bringing together and connecting all aspects of your desired traveling experience by expanding its offering of other travel verticals other than accommodations. Therefore, the company has been heavily focused on integrating flight opportunities and it released Priceline Experiences to enable customers to quickly search and book more than 80,000 activities in over 100 countries.\\n\\nIdeally, Booking Holdings Inc. wants to offer a platform to its customers that allow them to arrange every aspect of their trip on a single platform to increase customer engagement and loyalty to the platform over time. And indeed, speaking from my personal experience, a more seamless, flexible, and complete Booking experience seems like the best way to achieve higher customer engagement. Everyone who has ever arranged a trip or vacation must have wished at some point that you could just do it all through a single app, instead of having to switch between several ones every second and make it all work together.\\n\\nAll in all, I believe that a focus on a single platform offering all travel aspects can be a great loyalty driver and offer protection of the moat Booking Holdings currently has in the traveling industry. I think management is on the right path here and it is making progress toward this. The flight offering through the Booking.com platform is now available in over 50 countries and allows travelers to book another important travel component through this platform. And in addition to delivering more functionality to existing users, it is also attracting new users to the platform Booking stated during the earnings call that 20% of all flight bookers are new to the platform, illustrating that it is also a way to increase its user base.\\n\\nAnother important way to improve customer engagement and user experience and functionality is the mobile app, which management sees as the center of its connected trip vision. Of all nights booked in the fourth quarter, 45% were made through the online apps, which is in line with what we have seen for FY22 and 13% higher compared to 2019. Worldwide, the Booking.com app remains the number one in the number of downloads and according to a leading third-party research firm, Booking also moved to the number one spot in the U.S. last quarter.\\n\\nBusiness of Apps\\n\\nThat brings me to the final strategic priority to be discussed, which is a focus on strengthening its position in the U.S., where it is fighting against Airbnb as I already pointed out in the introduction. And while it is working hard on improving its strength here, management acknowledges that there is still much more work ahead. Still, growth for this region was strong last year as room night bookings grew by 30%, while gross bookings grew by 60% vs 2019. Based on these metrics, Booking has meaningfully grown its U.S. business compared to 2019, as it fights to take away market share from Airbnb.\\n\\nThe following statement was made during the recent earnings call:\\n\\nAnd we believe that our growth rate has outpaced the recovery in the broader market for U.S. accommodations, which means we believe we gained market share.\\n\\nFurther increasing its market share in the U.S. could be an excellent driver of further financial growth, but does not seem like a game changer in the near term while also being very challenging and uncertain.\\n\\nA more obvious growth driver for Booking seems to be the general growth of the travel accommodations industry. This one is expected to grow at an 11.3% CAGR until 2031 to reach a market size of close to $2 trillion. The traveling industry is massive and quite lucrative. It is therefore crucial for Booking to maintain its market share which explains the importance of all of management's actions discussed above. Also, the re-opening of China will be an additional growth driver for Booking Holdings as they have good exposure here. Overall, as one of the leading travel accommodation platforms, the strong double-digit predicted growth will be a massive growth driver for Booking as the company earns the largest part of its revenues within this industry.\\n\\nBalance Sheet\\n\\nAnother growth driver and reason to possibly invest in Booking is the strength of its balance sheet and incredible capital return program. With Booking remaining very positive about the long-term outlook for the travel industry and its strong balance sheet, it was able to return $6.5 billion to shareholders in 2022 by repurchasing its own shares (Booking does not offer a dividend). This means that Booking was able to lower its total share count by a massive 8% in a single year, and 22% over the last 5 years. This is very impressive, and management has already said that returning cash to shareholders remains a priority.\\n\\nThat management is very much focused on its shareholders is also proven by the following statement from the earnings call:\\n\\nWe view SBC expense as a very real cost of doing business across every stakeholder should fully count when evaluating the performance and returns of our business or any business. If anything, we view SBC dollars even more valuable than cash dollars because of our long-term expectation that dollars worth of stock to-date will be worth more in the future. It's the same expectation that serves as the rationale for pursuing our share repurchase program, a program that has meaningfully reduced our share count over time has not just served to offset dilution from SBC. Simply offsetting dilution does not represent a return of capital to shareholders, but actually represents a cash drain on our business that does not get counted in many companies' pro forma reporting of profits. In 2022, our stock-based compensation resulted in less than 0.7% of shareholder dilution. And during the last 5 years, it resulted in less than 3% of cumulative dilution. As I mentioned, during the same period, we reduced total share count by a net 22%, inclusive of the shares that were added as a result of our stock-based compensation activities. Our future practices will continue to be guided by the same two philosophical approaches that guide us decades, namely, number one, the stock-based compensation counts; and two, that our stock repurchases, first and foremost, are meant - are actively meant to return capital to shareholders in the form of share count reductions.\\n\\nI view these as incredibly impressive statements by management and showing just how aware they are of the well-being of their investors. In a time where there is much discussion about the stock-based compensation of technology companies like Salesforce (CRM) and The Trade Desk (TTD), this statement by Booking Holdings management is great to see for a change. This is a massive green flag for investors and such a focus on returning cash to shareholders, without diluting them, should be a great value driver for investors. Impressive!\\n\\nAnd the good news does not end there, as management expects its annual total return of capital to shareholders to be at least equal to its free cash flow over the next few years. And considering the great projected growth rates which I will discuss in the next segment, this sounds very promising.\\n\\nBooking Holdings Inc. currently still has $3.9 billion remaining under its current share repurchase program, which it announced in the second quarter of 2019. But with its financial results, Booking also announced a new share repurchase authorization of $20 billion that will begin once the previous one is fully completed. This means that as long as the travel industry continues to recover and grow from here as projected, investors should expect a total of $24 billion to be spent on share repurchases over the next 4 years, almost fully covered by free cash flow. This means that the company plans on retiring over 20% of its outstanding shares over this 4-year period which is, once again, very impressive.\\n\\nAllowing this is its strong balance sheet, which held a total cash position of $15.2 billion by the end of FY22. This was up from $11.8 billion with which the company ended the third quarter, despite repurchasing $2.3 billion of its own shares and the payment of $780 million of debt. So how did they still manage to increase the cash position by a staggering $3.4 billion?\\n\\nThis is driven primarily by the $3.6 billion bond offering we completed in Q4, the $2.1 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter, and about $600 million in proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction I mentioned previously\\n\\nWhile this means the company had some favorable one-offs, the share buyback was still almost completely covered by free cash flow, which is great to see. For FY22 Booking generated a very solid $6.2 billion in free cash flow, a 36% increase from 2019. Also, this shows that the FY22 buybacks were almost fully covered by free cash flow. In addition to a great cash position, Booking held about $13 billion of debt on the balance sheet which is covered by its cash position. In addition to this, the company started to sell down on its investment in Meituan and completed this in February. The total proceeds of the sale are $1.7 billion, a 250% increase from its initial investment. After taxes, the remaining $1.4 billion will be used to strengthen the balance sheet.\\n\\nOutlook & Valuation\\n\\nBesides delivering very strong results for its FY22, Booking Holdings Inc. also holds a positive view of the future as growth remains, driven by a further recovery in Asia and continued strengthening of the travel industry. The only real threat to this outlook seems to be a serious recession, but more on this later. That the enthusiasm by management is justified is reflected in the January results from Booking, which increased by 26% compared to 2019, or up 60% from January last year. This is what was said during the earnings call:\\n\\nWe are very encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand last year and into the new year which speaks to consumers' strong desire to travel.\\n\\nThe company saw a record high number of nights booked in January as this came in at 95 million. This was 10 million more than the previous monthly record from May last year, illustrating the strength of the platform entering 2023. This growth for the first month seemed to be driven by all regions apart from the U.S. Asia, in particular, was up 20%, seeing much of an improvement from last quarter. Of course, one should keep in mind that monthly numbers are a rough indication of the months ahead as these can be easily influenced by a number of factors. Still, a 74% increase in gross bookings is nothing to be negative about.\\n\\nAll in all, management expects to report 30% growth YoY for the first quarter, or 20% from the first quarter of 2019. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings is expected to be 10.3% which is 40 basis points higher compared to 2019. Expenses across the board are also expected to be a bit higher compared to last quarter but should be outpaced by revenue growth. This results in a projected 1Q23 EBITDA of $600 million, up 93% YoY. We should of course keep in mind that 1Q22 was still impacted by Omicron.\\n\\nFor the full year, management remains careful. The year so far is looking very good, but they are expecting quite a bit of volatility in the numbers. Using a conservative approach, considering the more difficult comparisons and moderation in growth, Booking expects to report gross booking growth in the low-teens percentages YoY. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings is expected to increase by 0.5% and should drive slightly higher revenue growth. And while fixed expenses are expected to grow by 20% for FY23, slowing down from there, management also expects record levels of EBITDA as margins should expand by a couple of percentages. This should most likely result in EPS growth in the high-teens percentages with revenue growth of low to mid-teens. This shows that Booking is still projecting solid growth ahead.\\n\\nSo, how is this reflected in the analyst estimates for both the first quarter and full year? For the first quarter, analysts are guiding for revenue of $3.77 billion, up close to 40% YoY. Considering that the total nights booked increased by 60% for January and this month last year was still impacted by Omicron, this looks about right. For EPS, this results in $10.79 which would represent a 177% increase YoY.\\n\\nFor FY23, analyst project revenue of $20 billion, up close to 17% YoY. This looks to be a somewhat higher outlook than given by management, but this one seemed to be overly conservative. EPS growth is expected to be 30% and result in an EPS of $130. Again, this looks to be somewhat higher than guided by management but looks fair considering all circumstances. I believe current analyst projections look very fair right now, but we can only really tell when Booking reports its second quarter results and needs to start lapping tougher comparable quarters.\\n\\nFor the period until 2026, analysts project Booking to keep reporting strong growth rates as the travel industry is fully recovering with all regions reopening and the industry returning to its historical growth, together with economic headwinds disappearing which should allow for consumers to start spending more easily again. In addition to this, Booking is doing all the right things to increase the user base which should be an additional driver of revenue. As a result, analysts project revenue growth of low double digits to high single digits in combination with EPS growth of 20% for FY24, moderating to 9% by 2026. With management enthusiastically returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and solid economic growth, investors look well positioned for decent returns, and growth rates by analysts look very reasonable.\\n\\nRevenue consensus (Seeking Alpha) EPS consensus (Seeking Alpha)\\n\\nBased on the current, reasonable, analyst non-GAAP EPS expectations, Booking is valued at a forward P/E of 20x. This is 57% below its 5-year average valuation of 47x. Of course, over the last several years profitability was heavily impacted by covid which caused an elevated and unreasonable P/E ratio. Still, I believe that based on the growth projections, moat, and shareholder-friendly approach of management, Booking deserves to be valued at a P/E of closer to 23x.\\n\\nBased on current non-GAAP EPS projections for FY23 and a P/E of 23x, I calculate a target price for Booking Holdings Inc. of $2990, or 14.4% upside from a current share price of around $2600.\\n\\nFor comparison, 34 Wall Street analysts currently have an average price target of $2736, combined with a buy rating on the shares. This price target leaves approximately a 4.5% upside.\\n\\nRisks\\n\\nWhile Booking Holdings Inc. is a really impressive company, an investment in the company is not risk-free, as illustrated over the last couple of years, when revenues fell to worrying levels. Luckily, the company is relatively asset-light and does not own any properties itself, making it a lot less risky compared to many accommodation peers.\\n\\nYet, this does open the company up to the risk of losing properties, supplier partners, and offerings to place on its platforms. With the company not owning any of the properties, hotels, and accommodations on its website, it does depend on people listing their accommodations on the platform. The platforms owned by Booking Holdings have a very broad reach and user base and as a result, many hotels and suppliers depend on the platform and have a long-standing relationship with the company. I, therefore, do not perceive this risk to be overly large or a short-term threat. Yet, this is something to keep an eye on when you own the shares.\\n\\nAnd whereas it makes Booking dependent on third-party accommodations, it does protect it somewhat from a potential recession as it won't be stuck with high maintenance costs. Of course, if a severe recession would hit and people were to lose their jobs, resulting in a general increase in unemployment, this would impact the amount people are willing or able to spend on vacations or trips. Therefore, Booking is sensitive to economic prosperity and a potential downturn. Over 2022, the recovery has been stronger than the economic headwinds with saving accounts still at their highest level in decades. 2023 is not expected to be different, but in future economic downturns, Booking could take another temporary hit. Of course, these impacts tend to be only temporary and should not break the overall growth trend that will benefit Booking Holdings.\\n\\nFinally, there is the risk of further market share losses to competitors like Airbnb. Management is very well aware of this risk which is the reason why they are investing heavy sums in making their offering stickier and more complete. Still, new competitors could arise that are better able to play into the latest consumer preferences or have a better overall offering.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nBooking Holdings Inc. was hit very hard by the covid-19 pandemic but has now managed to fully recover and return to growth. Its latest quarter proved this with very strong growth rates driven by renewed growth from the Asian continent. Booking continues to be the travel accommodations industry leader with its excellent broad exposure and impressive market share. The company is pulling several levers to maintain this position, while also expanding its user base by entering new markets.\\n\\nWith this company being led by an excellent management team and operating a very shareholder-friendly strategy, I have little to no doubts about the future of this company. Of course, no investment is risk-free but overall, the risk seems to be minimized for an investment in Booking Holdings. Considering the massive amounts of buybacks that are planned for the next 4 years, strong market position, and growth projections for Booking, I calculate a target price for Booking Holdings Inc. stock of $2990. This offers investors about 14.5% upside from its current price levels of around $2600, offering enough downside protection.\\n\\nTherefore, I rate Booking Holdings Inc. stock a buy with a 12-month price target of $2990. Booking Holdings Inc. offers decent upside potential, a shareholder-friendly management that does not dilute its shareholders, and exposure to the travel industry through one of the largest travel conglomerates.\"],\n",

       "  'After several years of hiatus, travel is back! Despite inflation driving the cost of vacations sky-high (quite literally, the cost of airfare in the U.S. was far outpacing the rate of inflation throughout 2022), households are planning on traveling more in 2023. According to data from the U.S. Travel Association, travel spending surpassed what was spent in 2019 and is showing few signs of cooling down.\\n\\nThis is more than \"revenge travel,\" or consumers making up for lost time during lockdowns. Speaking generally, younger generations highly value seeing new places. And there is a growing middle class in developing countries, and travel spending is rising among this demographic, too. There\\'s lots to like about making an investment in travel for the long haul, which means it pays to be well acquainted with Airbnb (ABNB -1.20%) and Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.13%) -- two top online travel marketplaces. Which is the better buy now?\\n\\nAirbnb dethroned in the growth department?\\n\\nAirbnb\\'s meteoric rise has been impressive. Despite its founding in just 2008, it commands a massive market cap valuing the business at $68 billion as of this writing. Booking, founded back in 1997 during the dot-com era (at the time it was still called Priceline), has a market cap value of $102 billion.\\n\\nBooking is undeniably the older and bigger business -- not just by market cap, but also in sales, registering more than double the revenue of Airbnb over the last year.\\n\\nBut something surprising just happened. Airbnb, by far the smaller business, just reported first-quarter 2023 year-over-year revenue growth of 20%. Not bad, given consumers are feeling the pinch from inflation. For the second quarter, though, management predicted revenue will increase just 14% year over year (at the midpoint of guidance).\\n\\nBy contrast, the behemoth Booking (which includes Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, and Kayak) reported Q1 2023 year-over-year revenue growth of 40%. Management anticipates Q2 nights booked to be up by about a mid-single-digit percentage year over year, which should equate to high-single-digit to low-teens revenue growth. The takeaway? Airbnb\\'s pace of expansion is moderating and quickly approaching Booking\\'s rate of growth.\\n\\nOversize luggage filled with cash\\n\\nOver the long term, Airbnb could have an edge if it solves some of its imperfections (traveler complaints about inconsistent quality in places to stay, for example). Additionally, Airbnb has been making it clear for some time it will expand into new areas of travel (perhaps rental cars next?). Booking has already done this over the years, rounding out its offerings with airfare tickets and restaurant management software -- to mixed results, I might add, like the lackluster acquisition of OpenTable in 2014, which it admitted it grossly overpaid for two years later.\\n\\nIn other words, Airbnb\\'s diminutive size compared to its larger peer could still be a key driver for the stock in the years ahead, versus the giant that Booking Holdings is already today.\\n\\nIf Airbnb can restart its growth engine, and remain highly profitable along the way like Booking has been able to do, this could still be the best long-term growth opportunity. For reference, Booking generated a free-cash-flow profit margin of nearly 42% over the last 12 months. Impressive, considering the business was still recovering from the deep pandemic slump. Airbnb generated a free-cash-flow margin of nearly 44% over the last 12 reported months.\\n\\nBoth companies use this enviable and steady stream of cash for shareholder returns -- specifically, stock repurchases. Airbnb returned $493 million to shareholders via stock repurchases in Q1 2023 (a policy it just started late last year), and Booking returned $2.15 billion, returning to its shareholder-friendly ways of times past.\\n\\nWhich is the better buy now?\\n\\nWhen I started buying Airbnb stock late in 2022, I thought it was the better value. Today, it looks to me like Booking Holdings is now the better value. If I were going to choose one travel stock to buy right now, my nod goes to Booking Holdings with a ratio of price to trailing-12-month free cash flow of less than 15. Airbnb trades for over 19 times trailing-12-month free cash flow.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note, though, that Booking is also losing some steam in its growth as the pandemic travel rebound is now complete. It\\'s a big world out there, and international travel can still keep this business in growth mode for a long time. But I fully expect Airbnb will be the faster-growing business when measured over the course of years, not quarters. Given near-term headwinds, Airbnb may not be the most timely buy. However, 2023 alone might not have much bearing on these two stocks\\' performance when looking back on them a decade from now.\\n\\nMy final verdict: Booking Holdings looks like more bang for your investment buck right now. But if Airbnb can get its expansion going again and maintain its high level of profitability, it could have a lot more growth potential over the long term. This is a trade-off between stability versus growth. Choose according to your preference.'],\n",

Booking.com and its rivals spend billions annually to woo those travelers who wouldn't otherwise click over to their platforms.\\n\\nOnline travel is a weird industry when it comes to its outsized marketing spend as compared with other types of businesses.\\n\\nNone of this is shocking because it’s been the pattern for many years, but a BTIG investor report published Thursday put Booking Holdings’ marketing spend in a different context.\\n\\nBooking Holdings, which owns brands including Booking.com, Kayak and Priceline, spent around $6 billion on marketing in 2022 — and that was about 35% of its total revenue. BTIG stated that Booking gets around 50% of its traffic direct; around 20 percent from free search engine listings; roughly 15% from social media, email, display ads and referrals, and 15% from paid search engine marketing — “and it spends billions annually to get that last piece.”\\n\\nThat’s worth repeating: Booking Holdings spent around $6 billion on sales and marketing last year to attract just 15% of visitors to its platform. (Sure, it directs some of that spend toward goals other than luring travelers to its platforms, but you get the general idea.)\\n\\nHow Expedia and Airbnb Do It\\n\\nOver at rival Expedia Group, its marketing spend was even more top-heavy — around 47% of revenue last year.\\n\\nAirbnb is an outlier in the online travel agency space because around 90% of its customers come directly to its website or app, as well as from free listings in search engines. You’ve heard the company’s talking points ad infinitum: Airbnb is so mainstream that it’s “a noun and a verb.”\\n\\nSo Airbnb focuses on limiting its paid search engine marketing on platforms like Google and Bing. Airbnb shelled out a very modest 18% of revenue on marketing in 2022.\\n\\nYes, before the hate mail arrives, it’s true that the three companies calculate marketing spend differently, but the basic points about their marketing spend as a portion of overall revenue hold true.\\n\\nAirbnb Smart, Booking Foolhardy?\\n\\nAll of this is a contrast to most U.S. industries, according to a 2022 Gartner survey, which found them planning to spend a relatively minuscule 6-10% on marketing as a percent of revenue last year.\\n\\nBut before you leap to the conclusion that Booking’s strategy (35% of revenue on marketing) is dumb, and Airbnb’s approach (just 18%) is valedictorian-worthy, consider that Booking’s profit margin was considerably higher than Airbnb’s or Expedia’s last year.\\n\\nBooking’s 2022 EBITDA margin was 31.3% compared with 23.2% for Airbnb, and 11.9% for Expedia. (True, their businesses are different as they sell some different things, and they are spread out across different geographies.)\\n\\nBooking “has historically had an advantage in paid channels with a higher conversion rate, allowing it to bid more efficiently,” the BTIG report stated.\\n\\nAnother way to look at Booking’s advantage over Expedia is in marketing spend as a percent of bookings, not revenue, and by this metric Booking was more efficient, 4.9% versus 5.7%, according to BTIG.\\n\\nMarketing as a Percent of Bookings, Booking Versus Expedia\\n\\nRegarding these companies’ big-stakes marketing programs, now you know how strategic it is for them to try to attract more free, direct traffic to their websites and to coax more app downloads. It’s all in the hope that their customers won’t stray once they land on their websites, and won’t have to be enticed with billions of marketing dollars all over again.\"],\n",

It has a trimmed down vision to focus on direct hotel relationships after two of the biggest online travel agencies in the world departed as partners.\\n\\nFearing another Expedia-like breakup, Hopper abruptly ended its hotel partnership with Booking Holdings a week ago, Skift has exclusively learned.\\n\\nHopper feared another blow to its reputation if a second major online travel agency, namely Booking.com, went public about a soured partnership so soon after Expedia Group did so in July, several travel industry sources and former employees said. Hopper told employees it proactively disconnected Booking.com’s accommodations supply last Friday, September 29.\\n\\nHopper was concerned how these hits on its brand reputation would impact business-to-business partnerships, such as with Capital One and other future distribution partnerships, as well as with existing airline partners, sources said.\\n\\nHopper announced a deal on September 27 that expanded its supply relationship with wholesalers Hotelbeds and WebBeds before Hopper disconnected Booking.com. Hopper was keen on terminating its relationship with Booking first — and it did so without advance notice — so that Booking couldn’t claim that it was the one to sever ties, and Hopper thus hoped to avoid negative fallout that would deter future supplier or distribution agreements.\\n\\n“The Hotelbeds deal wasn’t a done deal,” said one travel industry source. “So if Booking disconnected Hopper and would have made it public, like Expedia did, maybe Hotelbeds would have backed off the deal. Hopper disconnected Booking, so Booking wouldn’t announce anything.”\\n\\nThe existence of a partnership where Booking.com supplied hotel and short-term rental inventory to Hopper had been in existence for more than a year, possible much longer, but has not been publicly disclosed until this story.\\n\\nA source close to Booking Holdings said the company was testing Hopper’s fintech products across Booking’s brands, had been supplying Hopper with accommodations inventory, and was looking to expand that inventory partnership for Hopper’s consumer and B2B businesses in exchange for a traditional revenue share arrangement when Hopper ended the partnership an alleged “breach of contract.”\\n\\nBooking Holdings is not challenging that perceived contract violation because Hopper’s fintech products performed so poorly there was little adverse financial impact, the source said.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Booking Holdings confirmed Friday that the company is no longer working with Hopper.\\n\\nHopper didn’t respond substantively to several requests for comment.\\n\\nHopper Didn’t Want Another Expedia-Like Blowup With Booking\\n\\nThe Expedia withdrawal from Hopper adversely impacted Hopper’s bottom line, and complicated partner relations, according to several sources.\\n\\nFor example, United Airlines gave Hopper a 30-day notice that it planned to end its Hopper partnership after the Expedia blowup. However, United stayed on after Hopper met some of its demands, including eliminating strike-through pricing of higher fares, and providing an incentive to first-time bookers of Hopper carrot cash to subsidize their initial bookings, according to a former employee who was laid off.\\n\\nUnited saw both of these measures as undercutting United’s airfares.\\n\\n“The Expedia exit was impactful,” a former Hopper employee said. “As much as Hopper said it wasn’t — it was.”\\n\\nThe Layoffs Came Two Business Days Later With an Initial Slack Notification\\n\\nHopper employees would learn that layoffs were imminent two business days later on Tuesday when Hopper co-founder and President Dakota Smith sent a Slack message and email informing the staff that their managers would contact them if they were being laid off, sources said. (See the email, which Skift obtained, embedded below.)\\n\\nSmith wrote that Hopper decided to conduct a reorganization “to support our higher growth, priority areas, and more quickly move toward profitability. Unfortunately, this means that we will be reducing the size of our workforce today and some of our colleagues across the globe and across departments will be affected.” He told those on the hit list that their managers would be contacting them shortly.\\n\\nAfter managers contacted the selected employees and informed them they were fired, they were locked out of Hopper software within minutes, making it impossible for some to bid goodbye to their fellow employees or to retrieve any materials, sources said.\\n\\nA press report, which Hopper didn’t deny, said it laid off 30% of its workforce, or 250 employees, on Tuesday. Among the casualties were the general manager of Europe, and marketing managers in Europe and Latin America.\\n\\nAnother as yet unreported aspect of the reorganization is that the company shuttered Hopper Homes, its vacation rental offering. It remains to be seen how Hopper can be a force in accommodations with its Millennial and Gen Z audience without vacation rentals. Hopper’s corporate travel teams also took a massive hit.\\n\\nWhen Expedia Group ended its Hopper relationship in July, Expedia’s Vrbo vacation rental unit likewise stopped supplying Hopper with those properties. Hopper had numerous other vacation rental partners, including Evolve, Hostaway, and Vtrips.\\n\\nThe Layoffs Hit Hard\\n\\nThis is how one now-former Hopper employee described the layoff process:\\n\\n“Everyone was traumatised. Nobody knew if they were going to be let go or not. After this I witnessed how colleagues started disappearing from Slack one by one. I was in the middle of the meeting [a town hall] and my colleague was called and she started to cry. She left the meeting, and five minutes after she disappeared from Slack. About 10 minutes passed and I also received the call from my manager This call lasted 2 minutes. My manager told me he/she did not know why the decision happened, but there was nothing he/she could do.”\\n\\nSee the Hopper email to employees about layoffs and the company’s strategy below:',\n",
       "  'Leslie Cafferty travels a lot. Given that she’s the chief communications officer of travel tech group Booking Holdings, that shouldn‘t come as a surprise, but even the keenest jet-setter might find her schedule alarmingly hectic.\\n\\nWhen we speak on a Thursday, she’s in France for an advertising conference. At the weekend, she’ll be back with her family in the US. On Monday, she’ll be heading back across the Atlantic to Amsterdam for a team meeting at the HQ of Booking.com, the group’s flagship brand. It’s not an uncommon itinerary, as she balances spending time with colleagues in Europe and the US, where Booking Holdings is based.\\n\\n“I know how to get myself to sleep quickly on the red-eye,” Cafferty says. “I’m on the road half the time. When I’m not, I’m working across different time zones. I start meetings by 6am, so that I’m done by 4pm when I am at home. That wouldn’t work for everyone, but it does for me.”\\n\\nShe has been leading Booking Holdings’ comms team for more than 10 years. It’s a varied role at a group that also features brands such as Kayak, OpenTable and Rentalcars.com. Cafferty sits within the parent company, in charge of the communications strategy for a concern that collectively employs more than 20,000 people worldwide.\\n\\nThe job suits an assured and transparent leadership style, as she explains: “The nature of this role means that you must make fast decisions. If there’s been a data breach, for instance, the media might give you a five-minute deadline for a response. And you have to be open about both the good and the bad. If you’re transparent, that builds your credibility. I make us constantly analyse what’s gone well and where we can improve.”\\n\\nMixing strategic and reactive roles\\n\\nCafferty’s route into the comms profession was fairly unconventional. She studied international relations at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania before considering going to law school, but had “no idea” what she wanted to do when she graduated.\\n\\nLeslie Cafferty’s CV Booking Holdings\\n\\n2022-present: chief communications officer\\n\\n2018-22: senior vice-president and head of global communications\\n\\n2013-18: vice-president and head of global communications Nielsen\\n\\n2011-13: vice-president, global marketing and communications InterActiveCorp (IAC)\\n\\n2004-11: director, global communications Expand Close\\n\\nShe found an assistant role at InterActiveCorp (IAC) which was transitioning at the time from a broadcaster to an internet business. It was an exciting period to be at the company, led by charismatic media mogul Barry Diller. Cafferty recalls that he was “always doing or saying something that was making headlines”.\\n\\nIAC had an opening on the communications team, which she thought looked better than answering the phones. After landing the job on her second attempt, she found it “fascinating”, loving the unpredictable nature of the comms function and the fact that it interacts with so many parts of the business.\\n\\nShe rose through the ranks to become director of global communications before moving to market research giant Nielsen in 2011. But she missed the buzz of working in tech and so, when the vacancy at Booking Holdings came up two years later, she seized the opportunity.\\n\\nFor Cafferty, it’s the mix of the reactive and the strategic that really appeals. Although outsiders tend to view Booking.com as a travel business, the comms strategy focuses on positioning it as a tech company. But every member of her 60-strong team has to be ready to drop everything and pitch in whenever something unexpected happens, which has been quite often in recent years. Booking.com must deal with the fallout from events far beyond its control, from the Covid crisis to Russia’s war on Ukraine. How it communicates about such matters is key, she says.\\n\\nDealing with a backlash against the business\\n\\nCafferty also wants the business to be well known for its strong progressive values. When we speak, the backlash against Bud Light is still reverberating. She believes that the leadership team’s lack of consistency was a huge error for the beer brand.\\n\\n“They’d made half the world angry [with the original video] and all they did [in response to vehement criticism] was make the other half just as angry,” she explains. “That’s when you have to know your standpoint.”\\n\\nWhen she received a call from the company’s lawyers advising her to err on the side of caution with transgender influencers, she ignored their guidance.\\n\\n“We’ve been working with transgender people for the whole time this company has been in business and we’ll continue to do so, because inclusivity is fundamental to who we are,” Cafferty argues. “We haven‘t faced a backlash but, if that were to happen, my advice would be that we must stand absolutely firm, because it is linked to our values.”\\n\\nThere’s no major decision that this company makes without consulting me and my team\\n\\nEnsuring a consistent response across a large group is no easy task, of course. When you’re dealing with a workforce of more than 20,000, having everyone understand the parent company’s view on sociocultural issues is “a constant work in progress”. But this is, she believes, central to creating the right culture and ensuring that employees are engaged.\\n\\nThat means including it as part of onboarding and holding annual refresher sessions to remind people what the company stands for. Anyone who’s likely to face the media is trained in its viewpoint and what information they can and cannot disclose.\\n\\nNonetheless, mistakes can and do happen. Cafferty recalls a time when one senior leader started deviating from policy by revealing details about the firm’s financial performance in China, for instance. Disgruntled employees have been known to “go rogue” as well, she says, adding that the key to mitigating this risk is to ensure that all staff feel that they’re being heeded, understood and respected.\\n\\n“If employees are happy and engaged, with clear messages about what can and can’t be discussed, we’re much less likely to face such issues. It’s all intertwined,” Cafferty says.\\n\\nBut unanticipated problems will always come out of the blue and require quick and effective solutions. She learnt one of her biggest – and toughest – lessons during the depths of the Covid crisis. At the time, the whole group was facing an uncertain future as governments around the world imposed stringent travel restrictions. With its HQ in Amsterdam, Booking.com was entitled to state aid. When it took the assistance on offer, it faced an almighty public backlash.\\n\\nCafferty describes it as the worst criticism the business has faced during her tenure, admitting that “we had no idea how we were perceived in that market and therefore that there would be this backlash against what’s seen as an American firm accepting Dutch government aid. With hindsight, we shouldn’t have taken it, but at the time there was no travel and we were already having to lay people off. That was a huge lesson for me.”\\n\\nRaising the profile of the communications function\\n\\nShe cites it as a reason why the communications function should be represented at the top table in more businesses. That’s a more common situation in the US than it is in the UK, but it’s reasonably rare even there for the comms chief to report directly to the CEO, as she does.\\n\\nThat is starting to change, Cafferty says, partly because of the pandemic but also because of the rise of social networks; the increasing public scrutiny that businesses and their leaders attract; and the changing role of the media.\\n\\n“Gone are the days when you could just push a press release, have someone write a story based on it and that would be that. Relationships matter, so comms has become much more highly valued,” she says. “There’s no major decision that this company makes without consulting me and my team. Most of it has nothing to do with comms, but people recognise that any decision could affect a company’s reputation.”\\n\\nThis means that much of her role entails offering advice in the C-suite and acting as a sounding board for key decision-makers. Cafferty describes her relationship with the CEO and president, Glenn Fogel, as one where they argue “in a good way” every day, debating issues and seeing where they land.\\n\\nIt also means that internal communication is as much a part of the job as external comms. But it isn’t necessarily the more straightforward element, especially when it comes to choosing what subjects to broach with employees.\\n\\n“There are principles we try to abide by,” says Cafferty, who explains that she and her colleagues will ask themselves a couple of key questions. “First, do we have the right to speak about an issue – does it relate to travel or technology? Second, is that issue relevant in places where we have people? If it isn’t, while we might personally feel passionate about it, it’s not our place [to state an opinion]. And then it’s a case of having debates and using our instincts.”\\n\\nYou get the impression that Cafferty has the instincts to get Booking Holdings through most challenges – and that she probably wins most debates.'],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 16, 0, 0): [\"The stock market has been booming in recent weeks. Some observers even believe we are in a new bull market since all three major indexes are now up more than 20% from their bear market lows. No matter how one wants to label it, investor optimism has certainly improved.\\n\\nIf you're looking for stocks to capitalize on the market rebound, keep reading to see three that still look like good buys right now.\\n\\n1. Signet Jewelers\\n\\nSignet Jewelers (SIG -1.41%) doesn't get a lot of attention in the financial media, but the company has a number of competitive advantages in the jewelry industry.\\n\\nIt's the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, giving it unmatched economies of scale. It's gained market share through acquisitions like Blue Nile and through organic growth, including in its digital channel, as it can make investments in tech that smaller independent retailers can't.\\n\\nThe company just reported first-quarter earnings, and the stock fell on the news as management cut its guidance due to macroeconomic headwinds that appeared toward the end of the quarter.\\n\\nWhile the company beat estimates for the first quarter, it now sees adjusted earnings per share of $9.49 to $10.09 for the year. This means that even with that dialed-down guidance, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just above 6, which is especially cheap for a consumer discretionary stock in a recessionary climate.\\n\\nThere's also good reason to expect Signet's performance to bounce back. About half of the company's business comes from the bridal segment, including engagement rings, wedding bands, and other jewelry related to weddings. Engagements have slowed due to a pause in new relationships during the worst of the pandemic. However, the company expects weddings to begin to pick up by the end of the year, meaning the business is well-positioned for a recovery next year.\\n\\nAdditionally, the company is planning to cut costs by up to $250 million, in part from continuing to rationalize its store base, which should help juice profitability as the bridal business returns. At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 6, the stock is too cheap to ignore and looks like an easy win from here.\\n\\n2. Booking Holdings\\n\\nTravel is back, and there's no bigger travel stock than Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.13%). Booking, which owns its namesake site, Kayak, Priceline, Rentalcars.com, Agoda, and OpenTable, is the world's biggest online travel agency and does more in bookings than any other hotel chain.\\n\\nRevenue jumped 40% in its most recent quarter, and the company should benefit from a pullback in the value of the dollar over the rest of the year as most of its business comes from outside the U.S.\\n\\nBooking's growth is expected to moderate as the initial boom from the post-pandemic reopening fades. However, the company benefits from its strong brand and positioning in a high-margin business, connecting travelers with hotels. As revenue continues to grow, the company's margins should expand as it gains leverage on fixed costs like salaries.\\n\\nBooking also has a long track record of buying back stock. It's reduced shares outstanding by about a third over the last decade.\\n\\nGoing forward, the company seems well-positioned to benefit from the growth in the travel industry. Trends like remote work should support increased levels of leisure travel compared to pre-pandemic times, and people have shown a preference for spending on services like travel and restaurants rather than goods as they make up for lost time during the pandemic lockdowns.\\n\\nWith its high-margin business model, Booking should capitalize on that windfall, paving the way for opportunistic share buybacks.\\n\\n3. Carnival\\n\\nCarnival (CCL -2.11%), the world's biggest cruise line operator, is another travel stock that looks poised to continue to recover.\\n\\nWhile Booking has an asset-light business model, Carnival is the opposite. Its ships come with high fixed costs, and that led the company to take on a lot of debt and dilute shareholders during the pandemic's height.\\n\\nHowever, the good news is that leverage cuts both ways, and booking trends are around record levels. Carnival has the potential to be highly profitable if demand is strong and prices are up, and that perfect storm seems to be brewing.\\n\\nIn fact, Wall Street is now taking notice. The cruise operator has scored several upgrades in recent weeks as analysts noted that booking trends continue to be robust.\\n\\nCarnival posted a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss in its first-quarter report, a seasonally slower time of year. However, the company said customer deposits reached a first-quarter record of $5.7 billion, 16% above the previous level in its history. It also experienced the highest booking volumes for any quarter in its history, a clear sign demand is returning in full force.\\n\\nThat points to record profits coming down the pike, and Carnival should be able to leverage those gains to pay down debt and buy back stock, restoring its balance sheet. As long as demand remains strong, the stock should continue its rebound, as it's still well below pre-pandemic levels.\"],\n",

While a site like ours can maybe handle a piece of the trip and do it very well, you’re still left at your own mercy to go off and put the rest of it together, pay for it in multiple places and if anything goes wrong, heaven help you,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We believe planning, booking and experiencing travel to be more personal and more enjoyable is a great way to drive value for our customers and our partners.”\\n\\nCommenting on potential areas of investment, Goulden said non-accommodation verticals, such as car rentals, are important since they enable people to experience the connected trip beyond the core market in Europe.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe also mentioned interest in solutions that create a seamless, personalized trip, for example offering the five most suitable accommodation options as opposed to thousands.'],\n",

Booking CEO Fogel knows, though, that sometimes the best decision is not overpaying and walking away from that shiny object.\\n\\nWhether it is out of ego or for personal financial incentives, companies sometimes do mergers and acquisitions for the wrong reasons, and many academic studies show that takeover deals generally turn out to be “losers.”\\n\\nThat’s the view of Booking Holdings and Booking.com CEO Glenn Fogel, who was interviewed several weeks ago on the subject of leadership for a podcast, C-Suite Conversations With Scott Miller.\\n\\nDealmaking can be incredibly perilous, Fogel said, adding: ““you are playing with live ammunition.”\\n\\nAcquisitions can be very “disruptive,” Fogel said, and companies need to be aware of how these deals would impact shareholders, employees and customers.\\n\\nEven before becoming CEO, Fogel was involved in many of the Bookiing’s acquisitions, including for Active Hotels (2004), Bookings B.V. (2005), Kayak (2013), and OpenTable (2014). As CEO, Fogel’s Booking acquired Getaroom (2021), and its proposed purchase of eTraveli Group is pending regulatory approval.\\n\\nFogel said he doesn’t recall ever making an acquisition for the wrong reasons although he’s tabled discussions and/or never returned to negotiations when he’s found out something about the management team he didn’t like or uncovered other problems.\\n\\nFogel Walked Away From a Deal in Europe\\n\\nAlthough Fogel didn’t mention during the podcast any specific deal he’s walked away from, in 2018 he did talk about one for Skift’s The Oral History of Travel’s Greatest Acquisition: Booking.com.”\\n\\nA rival, Expedia, announced the acquisition of Italian hotel booking site Venere in July 2008, but prior to that Booking.com management met several times with Venere’s founders in Rome about doing a deal, Fogel said.\\n\\n“The founders were having arguments and they really wanted to sell it, be done and leave,” Fogel said. “And just hand it off.”\\n\\nFogel’s team asked the Venere founders who would run the brand if they departed, and they replied that Stef Noorden, who had served as Booking.com CEO, could head up Venere.\\n\\n“Now Stef spoke many languages, like a lot, but he doesn’t speak Italian,” Fogel recalled. “He says, ‘I don’t speak Italian.’ “Well, you can learn Italian.’ We’re looking at them and say, ‘No.’ We just looked at each other said, ‘No. I don’t think having Stef learn Italian is really the right way to do this.'”\\n\\nThat was the end of that negotiation.\\n\\nOpenTable Was Too Early\\n\\nAsked during the recent podcast whether deals sometimes get consummated too early, Fogel acknowledged that the company’s 2014 acquisition of OpenTable, which has been subjected to impairment charges over the years, may have been premature.\\n\\nWhen Booking acquired OpenTable, the thought was that the brand and its restaurant partners would be able to take advantage of travelers dining out during their trips rather than solely servicing locals, Fogel said. At one juncture, Booking had planned to integrate OpenTable restaurant reservations across the Booking’s various brands, but it doesn’t do that today.\\n\\n“We still have not been able to really capitalize on that thought,” Fogel said, referring to travelers making dining reservations at their vacation spots. “So we were a little early on that.”\\n\\nBooking Used Pandemic Lessons in Russia and Ukraine\\n\\nReprising an issue he raised at Skift Global Forum in September 2021 in New York, Fogel told the podcast recently that Booking was not nimble enough during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 as it could have been despite frequently citing pandemic risks over the years in it its financial filings.\\n\\nHe said Booking was much better prepared starting in January 2022 for the Russia-Ukraine War, which broke out in late February of that year. Fogel said the company readied several scenarios and evacuated employees out of Russia and Ukraine, although he cited at least one tragedy.\\n\\nFogel said at one point Ukraine employees who fled Kiev returned to the office there because Kiev was considered safer than where they relocated to. “We lost an employee’s husband to a missile,” he said.\\n\\nFogel said it is important to keep business setbacks, such as losing a little money from time to time, in perspective because they are nothing compared to such a loss of life.\",\n",

The news marks the company\\'s delivery on its commitment to launch its first-of-its-kind program for accommodations enterprise-wide by the end of 2023.\\n\\nTravel Sustainable provides credible information on impactful sustainability efforts taken by properties worldwide and gives travelers a transparent, consistent and easy-to-understand way to identify a wider range of more sustainable stays, no matter where they want to travel. The aim of the program is to give visibility to accommodations that have made progress on a broad spectrum of sustainability efforts, from those at an earlier stage to those who have achieved one of more than 40 recognized ecolabels and certifications through outstanding commitments and investments. Pioneered by Booking.com, which recently marked the one year anniversary of the program , there are now more than 400,000 accommodations recognized globally by the Travel Sustainable program.\\n\\nRecognized properties across Priceline, Agoda and KAYAK will now feature the Travel Sustainable badge in search results, with some platforms also implementing an additional filter to help travelers book more sustainable accommodations. The program across brands provides recognition for properties that are taking steps to operate more responsibly with regards to their impact on the environment and their local communities, while encouraging partners to continue making progress towards the goal of eventual third-party certification, which remains the gold standard in the industry.\\n\\nThe combined effort across the company\\'s brand product teams to create the purpose-built, cross-enterprise API for the program is a signal of the potential for collaboration to drive greater sustainable impact across the travel industry by educating and empowering both partners and travelers to make sustainability a priority.\\n\\nFurthermore, the milestone is a result of actions taken by Booking Holdings and its family of brands to deliver against key commitments outlined in the company\\'s Climate Action Plan , the first of its kind for any global online travel company, which was released earlier this year.\\n\\nWhile accommodations are the first priority for the program, Booking Holdings will continue to evolve Travel Sustainable for transportation-related verticals to drive awareness of more sustainable options across more areas of a trip. Efforts include features live today like KAYAK\\'s CO2 sorter, which allows travelers to sort their flight search by CO2 emissions, and filters for electric and hybrid rental cars now live across Booking.com, KAYAK and Priceline where inventory is available, with further innovation to come by the end of 2023.\\n\\n\"Sustainability is a core component of our mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world, and with this important step we are making progress towards ensuring there is always a world worth experiencing,\" said Glenn Fogel, CEO, Booking Holdings. \"We remain committed to making our vision for more sustainable travel a reality through the breadth of our sustainable travel offerings, the size of our impact, and the potential of transparent, inclusive standards development to spur change for the whole sector.

Enjoy\\n\\nBooking Holdings’ eTraveli Acquisition Remains Under Review. It’s been a few weeks since we last updated the status of Booking Holdings’ long proposed acquisition of flight platform, eTraveli. With the month of August rapidly coming to a close, it is crunch time for both Booking Holdings and the EU Commission regulators who are scrutinizing the proposed transaction. Regulators are expected to issue their decision at the end of the month. Regulators have expressed concern that the transaction will further cement Booking.com’s dominant position in the EU, particularly for hoteliers. In response, Booking has recently proposed offering users who book flights on Booking.com a “carousel” of hotel options – featuring hotels available not only on Booking.com, but other platforms as well. While some speculate that sister-company Kayak might be source of this alternative hotel inventory, it isn’t clear yet where the additional inventory might be sourced (e.g., competing hotel platforms, hotels’ own booking channels, etc.).

On Wednesday this past week, Air Canada announced that it was partnering with Hopper to offer passengers booking on Air Canada’s website the option to purchase policies allowing them to cancel their flights at any time for any reason on eligible fares.

       " datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 16, 0, 0): [\"Booking Holdings' proposed remedy to push through its pending deal to acquire eTraveli Group may not be enough. Perhaps additional concessions or litigation are in the offing.\\n\\nBooking Holdings has proposed a remedy to a hotel issue that is threatening European Commission approval of its roughly $1.8 billion deal to acquire flight tech company eTraveli Group — show hotels from competitors when someone books a flight.\\n\\nThe potential solution might include something like this: After someone books a flight on Booking.com, the company would use sister brand Kayak to offer a variety of hotel choices from rival online travel agencies and perhaps the hotels themselves.\\n\\nKayak is a metasearch — or comparison shopping site — so if the traveler was flying from Amsterdam to New York City, then Kayak might display rates from Virgin Hotels New York City via Expedia.com, Hotels.com or Orbitz; Hilton Club the Quin New York from those same or other rivals, and other properties, as well.\\n\\nIt’s unclear whether Booking Holdings would also include booking options from its own brands, such as Booking.com, Priceline, and Agoda.\\n\\nThe idea is to appease the European Commission’s fear that the acquisition would not only strengthen Booking.com’s flights businesses, but would also bolster the company’s already market-shaping hotels business.\\n\\nEuropean regulators are balking at allowing the consummation of Booking Holdings’ nearly two-year-old agreement to acquire flight-tech company eTraveli Group, based in Sweden, because they think the consolidation would hike costs for hotels and guests. eTraveli Group has a relatively small hotel business, and Booking.com is its main partner.\\n\\nThe European Commission, which has been scrutinizing the proposed marriage for several months, is expected to make a decision on the deal by August 30. Regulators in the UK already gave their blessing.\\n\\n“Competition is already limited in the hotel OTA (online travel agencies) market and Booking appears to be unconstrained by competing OTAs, hotels and end-customers,” the European Commission said in a statement in June.\\n\\nThe EU competition watchdog said the deal may increase Amsterdam-based Booking Holdings’ bargaining position towards hotels and divert demand from cheaper alternative sales channels.\\n\\nBooking.com stated in July that it expects to meet the European Union’s definition of being a “gatekeeper” by the end of 2023. Gatekeepers, under the Digital Markets Act, have a significant impact on the EU market and “link a large user base to a large number of businesses.” Google told the EU that it already meets that definition.\\n\\nWhat this means under the European Union’s Digital Markets Act is that tech companies of this size — having at least an $82 billion market cap and 45 million active monthly users — will see some of their operations or business practices restricted. Meta/Facebook/Whatsapp, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft would also feel the pain.\\n\\nReuters was among the first to report that Booking had offered to display a variety of hotel choices to flight bookers as a proposed remedy to get approval for the eTraveli merger, but the report didn’t specify how Booking might do that.\",\n",
       "  'We saw during the pandemic how important it was for companies to have plenty of cash and the ability to borrow more. Airbnb and Booking Holdings have ample resources for big things on their to-do lists.\\n\\nEditor’s Note: Every Wednesday, Executive Editor and online travel rockstar Dennis Schaal will bring readers exclusive reporting and insight into the business of online travel and digital booking, and how this sector has an impact across the travel industry.\\n\\nMajor online travel agencies feel a ton of competitive pressures, but one thing is clear: They throw off a ton of cash.\\n\\nAnd they can use that cash wad for things like acquisitions, product development, and share repurchases.\\n\\nWe took at a look at free cash flow conversion for Airbnb, Booking Holdings and Expedia Group for the 12 months that ended June 30, 2023. Free cash flow conversion is a measure of how efficiently companies turn revenue into free cash flow after interest payments.\\n\\nAmong these three online travel agencies, Airbnb’s was at the top at 31%, followed by Booking Holdings at 28%, and Expedia Group at 19%. As a much larger company, Booking generated nearly twice the free cash flow as Airbnb, but Airbnb did it more efficiently.\\n\\nOnline Travel Agencies’ Free Cash Flow ($ billions) for 12 Months Ending June 30, 2023\\n\\nCompany Revenue Free Cash Flow FCF Conversion Airbnb $9,088 $2,830 31% Booking Holdings $19,341 $5,504 28% Expedia $12,260 $2,289 19%\\n\\nOne factor behind this trio of companies notching attractive free cash flow conversion numbers is that they are all asset light businesses, meaning they don’t own the hotels or short-term rentals that they offer and which generates much of their revenue. Airbnb doesn’t offer flights, cruises or car rentals; Booking and Expedia do, but don’t own any commercial aircraft, ships, or vehicles, either.\\n\\nWhen comparing the free cash flow conversion percentages to asset heavier businesses, Delta’s equivalent figure was 2% and hotelier Accor was 8%. Accor owns more of its properties than does Hilton, which had a free cash flow conversion of 42%.\\n\\nFree cash flow gives companies like Airbnb, Booking, and Hilton lots of flexibility in returning value to shareholders and for strategic moves. After all, Hilton obviously needs another hotel brand.\\n\\n“And because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we’ve been able to repurchase $2.5 billion of our stock in the last 12 months, which has more than offset the impact of share dilution,” Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told analysts earlier this month.\\n\\nIt might also position Airbnb to make acquisitions, perhaps an AI startup if that is its bent.\\n\\nThat’s not to underestimate the challenges that online travel agencies face.\\n\\nIn a December 2021 podcast, below, Skift Research’s Seth Borko and I discussed how the pandemic recovery would be more muted for online travel agencies than their robust 9/11 bounce back.\\n\\nBooking Holdings Chief Financial Officer David Goulden said during the company’s August 3 earnings call that the it would not revert to pre-pandemic margins because it is getting bigger in relatively low-margin businesses like flights and payments.\\n\\nWith hotels managing to maintain the integrity of their rates — ensuring they have the lowest rates on their own websites — to a larger degree than in years’ past, online travel agencies such as Expedia and Booking tend to no longer be the place that travelers can rely on as the source for the lowest discounted prices.\\n\\nThat’s why online travel agencies such as Booking.com, Expedia, Hopper, MakeMyTrip and eDreams Odigeo are focusing more on funding their own discounts to undercut competitors’ rates.\\n\\nStill, the online travel agencies’ ability to churn out cash gives them lots of options.'],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 28, 0, 0): [\"In the digital age, travel has been revolutionized by online platforms that offer convenient access to accommodation, flights, and experiences. At the forefront of this evolution stands Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG, Financial), the parent company of the well-known booking.com website. Renowned as the global leader in online accommodation bookings, the company has carved its niche through strategic acquisitions and a relentless focus on user experience.\\n\\nA giant in online accommodation booking\\n\\nBooking.com, the crown jewel in Booking Holdings portfolio, has become synonymous with seamless accommodation bookings. With a staggering listing of over 2.7 million properties across 220 countries, the platform provides travelers with a vast array of choices. However, the company's reach extends beyond booking.com, encompassing a suite of travel-related websites including Priceline (offering discount travel), Agoda (catering to the Asia-Pacific market), rentalcars.com, Kayak (a comprehensive travel comparison site) and OpenTable (a reservation platform for US restaurants).\\n\\nConsistent performance and investor appeal\\n\\nInvestors seeking a solid performer with both recent and long-term gains have found a favorable candidate in Booking Holding. The company's shares have surged this year. This consistent growth trajectory reflects the company's ability to adapt and thrive amidst changing market dynamics.\\n\\nA robust business model\\n\\nCentral to Booking's success is its multifaceted revenue generation model. The company predominantly earns revenue through commissions from providers such as hotels and airlines, facilitated by its online travel reservation services. In addition, Booking taps into advertising, restaurant reservations and insurance segments to diversify its income streams.\\n\\nThe nature of these revenue sources influences profitability; agency revenues, which involve commissions for accommodations, rental cars and airline bookings, are realized after customers complete their trips. On the other hand, merchant revenues arise from payments for services at the time of booking.\\n\\nShifts in revenue mix and margin dynamics\\n\\nHistorically, agency revenues dominated Booking's gross booking revenues, reflecting its commission-based model. However, recent years have witnessed a shift, with merchant revenues gaining ground. This transformation holds significance, offering insights into the company's profit margins. As the company engaged in increased payment processing and introduced flight bookings, margin dynamics evolved.\\n\\nWhile payment processing yields lower margins, flight booking margins are comparatively lower than those linked to accommodations. Despite slight declines in overall revenue margins, Booking remains well-positioned due to its robust volume growth. The company's operational gearing, driven by increasing volumes, bodes well for future margin expansion. Furthermore, enhanced profitability is supported by a trend towards more direct sales, reducing customer acquisition costs and boosting marketing efficiency.\\n\\nNavigating a competitive landscape\\n\\nBooking's success story is not devoid of challenges. The travel industry has witnessed disruptions from formidable rivals such as Airbnb Inc. (ABNB, Financial) and Expedia Group Inc. (EXPE, Financial), who introduced alternative accommodations and unique travel experiences. Acknowledging this, Booking is venturing into alternative accommodations, a market it was initially underrepresented in.\\n\\nThe company also contends with competitors like Hotels.com, Trivago and Tripadvisor (TRIP, Financial). Notably, competition extends beyond traditional players, as tech giants like Google enter the travel search arena. Booking and its peers invest significantly in Google advertising to maintain visibility in this fierce landscape.\\n\\nInnovation and growth strategy\\n\\nBooking's resilience lies in its simplicity: offering competitive prices, an extensive range of properties and user-friendly booking experiences. To fortify its position, the company is strategically expanding into flight reservations and alternative accommodations. A flagship endeavor is the Connected Trip initiative, aiming to streamline travel by enabling customers to book a holistic travel experience encompassing accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, restaurants and activities, all through booking.com.\\n\\nIncorporating artificial intelligence, this initiative aims to simplify and enhance the customer journey.\\n\\nSolid financial performance\\n\\nRecent financial performance underscores Booking's vitality. In the second quarter, the company reported exceptional results, surpassing market expectations. Record-high quarterly gross bookings were propelled by robust leisure travel demand, contributing to a remarkable 27% increase in revenues. Operational efficiencies and optimized marketing efforts led to an impressive 64% surge in Ebitda.\\n\\nEncouragingly, the company's guidance for the full year includes expectations of a 20% growth in room nights at slightly higher commission rates. The robust revenue growth is expected to translate into improved profit margins and continued strong free cash flow generation.\\n\\nShareholder value enhancement\\n\\nBooking's commitment to enhancing shareholder value is evident through its share buyback program. Having repurchased 5% of its shares in the first half of 2023 at a cost of $5 billion, the company is poised to engage in further buybacks, allocating $19 billion over the next four years. This strategic move aims to boost earnings per share by reducing the share count.\\n\\nValuation\\n\\nDespite its impressive recent performance, the shares are rated modestly undervalued by the GF Value Line. The stock has a GF Score of 84, indicating good outperformance potential. The stock has a solid Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9 and a very safe Altman Z-Score of 5.7.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nBooking Holdings has emerged as a dominant force in the travel industry, anchored by its flagship booking.com platform and a portfolio of travel-related websites. With a history of consistent growth, an adaptable business model and strategic initiatives focused on innovation and customer experience, the company is well-poised to continue its trajectory of success.\"],\n",

Many of Cruisebound's backers don't need the money, but they will have to prove themselves again nonetheless.\\n\\nEditor’s Note: Every Wednesday, Executive Editor and online travel rockstar Dennis Schaal will bring readers exclusive reporting and insight into the business of online travel and digital booking, and how this sector has an impact across the travel industry.\\n\\nOnline Travel This Week\\n\\nThe old boys network in online travel — yes, let’s call it what it is — has reunited again to accomplish a formidable goal that has frustrated numerous startups in the past. The aim is to disrupt online cruise booking.\\n\\nNew York-based Cruisebound, founded in 2021, reportedly announced a $10 million Series A funding round led by former Booking Holdings chairman and CEO Jeffery Boyd and Par Capital Ventures. The cruise startup, which aims to simplify the complex and still predominantly offline process of booking a cruise, has raised $12.2 million to date, according to Crunchbase.\\n\\nIn addition to Boyd, who joins the Cruisebound board, and Par Capital, the Series A announcement and a list of all-male advisors and investors on Cruisebound.com include Tripadvisor co-founder Steve Kaufer; Concur co-founder Steve Singh; Booking Holdings/Priceline alum Adrian Currie and Arthur Kosten; the co-founders of Rocket Travel (acquired by Booking Holdings) Bjorn Larsen and Jay Hoffmann; TripIt co-founder Scott Hintz, and ex-Flight Centre Group exec Atle Skalleberg, among others.\\n\\nRocket Travel alums Pierre-Oliver Lepage is co-founder and CEO of Cruisebound, and Claire Gibbons is vice president of product.\\n\\nCruisebound, which appears to be emphasizing mobile bookings and targeting newbie cruisers, is trying to simplify and automate through online bookings the arduous process of selecting the right cruise, choosing a cabin in all their variations from within a maze of decks, and figuring out discounts, port charges, and what’s included and what’s not in the total price.\\n\\nCruisebound’s mobile website (there’s no mobile app) is sophisticated and fairly easy to use compared with other sites, and has features I haven’t seen before from the bevy of startups that have unsuccessfully tried to crack online cruise bookings over the years.\\n\\nFor example, customers can select the desired duration of the cruise by manipulating a slider. There is a video FAQ early in the booking process, powered by Tolstoy, where cruise consultant “Claire” offered pre-recorded advice on what’s included in the fare, whether the customer needs a passport, and which cruise to select among the assortment of major cruise lines such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean.\\n\\nFor additional questions, site visitors can email a form, and as with other cruise websites, Cruisebound lists a customer service phone number atop its homepage for inquiries.\\n\\n“We’re available 24/7 via phone, email or chat to help with questions, changes, and whatever else you need to make your cruise vacation a success,” the website says.\\n\\nSo Cruisebound doesn’t hope to strictly be an online endeavor, but if it can significantly streamline the online booking process and capture a chunk of customers without employing a bloated number of call center agents like a lot of other cruise-booking businesses must do, then perhaps the company has a chance to endure.\\n\\nOnline travel agencies from Orbitz to Travelocity and Tripadvisor have offered cruises since the earliest days of online travel, but have had to employ call center agents to finish off the bulk of bookings. That’s the case likewise with online travel company and tour operator Dreamlines, which acquired Cruise 1st in 2021.\\n\\nThe challenge for Cruisebound is that perhaps it will find out the hard way why cruise bookings have been stubbornly accomplished largely offline to this day for a reason. Often there are just too many questions about sailings, which come with relatively hefty price tags, to give cruisers the security of relying merely on an instant online booking.\\n\\nHope Bank, co-founder of Military Cruise Deals, argued that experienced travel agents are the key ingredient in growing a cruise business, and that “simplification is an elusive dream.” She said her company has trouble finding travel agents to hire because cruise training takes at least two years.\\n\\nCustomer service begins in earnest post-booking.\\n\\n“The sales and customer service requests are so numerous and specific that your average call-center agent struggles and has to resort to putting any caller on hold, for up to 40 minutes, while they research and ask a supervisor to assist in accomplishing the simplest of tasks,” Bank said.\\n\\nHere’s hoping Cruisebound — or other startups to come — can chip into that offline cruise stranglehold for efficiency’s sake and the benefit of cruisers.\\n\\nIn Brief\\n\\nHomeToGo on Track for Profitability in 2023\\n\\nShort-term rental shopping and booking site HomeToGo announced Wednesday that it has a much greater backlog of bookings (euro 32.5 million, or $34.5 million, up 72 percent) starting 2023 compared with the previous year, and that the company is confident it will break even on an adjusted earnings basis this year. An assortments of newly public companies, from Vacasa to Sonder, have likewise pledged to achieve black ink in 2023.\\n\\nTrip.com Group Looks for Business Normalcy in the Third Quarter\\n\\nJane Sun, CEO of China’s Trip.com Group, said at the World Economic Forum at Davos this week that domestic travel in the country is at greater levels than 2019, and bookings outside of China are growing at a triple-digit pace. Sun said she hopes China’s cross-border travel would revert to 2019 levels by the third quarter. Skift\\n\\nOyo Could Go Public by April\\n\\nAt the request of regulators in India, accommodation aggregator and operator Oyo plans to refile its initial public offering prospectus by the middle of February, and a source told Skift’s Peden Doma Bhutia this could mean that Oyo would be trading on the public markets by April. However, there have been a series of delays, with regulators seeking more information about Oyo’s valuation, and the litigation against it.

It now expects total income of $29.6 million to $33.1 million, compared to $25.4 to $29 million.\\n\\nThe updated top estimate would be an increase of 149 percent on its total income for the 12 months to March 31, 2022.\\n\\nThe deal with Booking.com to power its new corporate travel platform was signed in November 2019, and has significantly contributed to its post-pandemic recovery. “We have seen stronger than expected revenue performance with solid trading results including our Booking.com for Business partnership,” said CEO Darrin Grafton.\\n\\nAs part of that landmark 2019 deal, Booking Holdings invested $11.2 million in Serko, taking a 4.7 percent “cornerstone stake.” It later recruited travel tech veteran Jonathan Starkings to head the partnership.\\n\\nForward Bookings\\n\\nA new Booking.com for Business platform was launched by adopting Serko’s “next generation” booking and expense platform Zeno. The tool also includes features to manage food, drink, and entertainment, going beyond typical travel expenses and with a focus on the much obsessed about “connected trip” concept.\\n\\nZeno targets small and medium-sized businesses, although in May this year Serko joined forces with travel management company CWT to offer the platform as a “globally preferred travel booking tool” within its myCWT platform. In the same month it added Atlas Travel as a reseller partner for North America.\\n\\nFor the six months to 30 Sept. 2022 Serko saw a significant growth in Booking.com completed room nights, which grew 432 percent over a six-month period “reflecting ongoing progress within our unmanaged travel segment,” Grafton revealed in an earnings call on Nov 23. 2022.\\n\\nCurrently smaller businesses are widely regarded as driving the corporate travel recovery. Recent data from expense platform Embruse, for example, also shows business travel is coming back at volume. According to its latest quarterly SpendSmart Travel Trends report, the volume of international flights booked rose 998 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, and 73 percent on the 2022 third quarter.\\n\\n“The data indicate a resurgence in in-person meetings despite less favorable weather and macroeconomic conditions, suggesting that employers continue to see the value in bringing people together,” said Emburse CEO Eric Friedrichsen.\\n\\nBooking.com has also seen its bookings leapfrog year-over-year. A spokesperson for Booking said it doesn’t split out its corporate travel bookings, but based on whether users “self-disclose” their purpose as traveling for business, bookings represent 20 percent of total sales. However, the segment was recovering at slower pace than leisure bookings.\\n\\nIt’s not necessarily been an easy ride for Serko.

       " datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 2, 0, 0): ['Booking Holdings is one of the leading online travel agencies. The group offers a wide range of travel-related services, including hotel reservations, car rentals, airline reservations, combination holidays, tailor-made trips and cruises. It employs more than 20,000 employees and is present all over the world. Let\\'s find out more about the fundamentals of this company and why it could be a fruitful investment.\\n\\nFirst of all, Booking is #1.The company has an incredible sustainable competitive advantage (called \"moat\") and is a perfect example of a company with a \"network effect\". Like LinkedIn or Wikipedia, Booking is \"the place to go\" to book hotel accommodations for the simple reason that it has the largest available inventory in the world.\\n\\nThe quality of service is second to none, especially with the famous free booking option. It is rare for a business to combine industry leadership with outstanding service quality. This is a direct credit to the management.\\n\\nKeeping in mind that we are witnessing here a very clear distortion caused by the pandemic (the year 2020 distorts a bit the long term trend on finances), let\\'s look at the financial side over the decade 2012-2022, even though the 2022 results have not yet been released. Fortunately, the forecast here is quite reliable via the data estimated by the consensus on MarketScreener.\\n\\nFirst finding: revenues quadruple over the period, from $4.3 billion to $17 billion.\\n\\nSecond observation: accounting profits and real profits (free cash flows) are well reconcilable (they evolve together). Moreover, FCF conversion (transformation of EBITDA into FCF) is estimated at 92% for 2022, an excellent ratio.\\n\\nThird observation: profitability is exceptional, with a net margin (calculated in relation to the free cash flow margin) well anchored around 30%. This margin is calculated conservatively, by fully adjusting for stock option compensation and various provisions.\\n\\nAll things being equal, on an expected revenue of 17 billion in 2022, Booking Holdings is expected to produce a cash profit of about 5 billion dollars. If we relate this to the market capitalization (perfectly identical to the enterprise value because there is no net debt), the company is currently valued at 19 times cash profits.\\n\\nThis is for a superbly profitable business - 30% FCF margin with ROE around 50% - still growing strongly and protected by a sustainable competitive advantage that is getting stronger every day as the inventory grows.\\n\\nSource: MarketScreener\\n\\nOn a forecast basis, with revenues of 19 billion and then 21 billion anticipated by analysts in 2023 and 2024, still at comparable profitability levels, Booking should produce an annual cash profit of around 6 billion dollars within two years: So here we are on an estimated valuation for next year of 16 times earnings.\\n\\nCash flow management, on the other hand, is very easy to follow, with $28 billion in cash profits generated between 2011 and 2021: of these, $23 billion was used for share buybacks and only $5 billion for various acquisitions. So it\\'s good to see that the very impressive revenue growth was mostly organic, and we\\'re dealing with a premium business, buyable at this price for very long-term investors convinced of the platform\\'s merits. Other investors should keep an eye on the stock, because in the event of a pullback due to an exogenous cause (such as a generalized drop in the markets, complicated macroeconomic news related to the war in Ukraine) this could be an unavoidable entry point.'],\n",

Read coverage of the event at the link below.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel, Booking Holdings CEO, confirmed Wednesday that Booking.com has extended its contract with Swedish flight-tech company eTraveli Group eTraveli and would continue to build its fledgling flight business while appealing the European Commission’s objection to the $1.7 billion acquisition.\\n\\nHowever, he said the scaled-down strategy would mean going slower, and “consumers would end up paying.”\\n\\nFogel raised concerns about the blocking of the deal in a discussion with Skift Founding Editor Dennis Schaal at the Skift Global Forum in New York. “I absolutely believe they’re wrong on the facts, wrong on the law, and it’s the wrong policy,” he said.\\n\\nIn the commission’s view, the eTraveli deal would make Booking.com even stronger in hotel sales because an increasing number of flyers would be offered hotel deals when they buy airline tickets. The commission claims the company has more than 60% of the online hotel OTA market share in Europe, with a survey of 15,000 hotels indicating that the hotels were fearful the deal would boost Booking’s ability to raise prices.\\n\\nFogel questioned how owning eTraveli would change its ability to raise prices. “We’re currently doing business with eTraveli. We’ll be doing the same business after we own the shares of eTraveli. How does that impact anything? Again, the logic makes no sense at all.”\\n\\n“I’m against raising prices. I would not trust polls or surveys as agreeing to come out and make very serious decisions for the good of the entire society,” said Fogel.\\n\\nConsidering the impact of a failed appeal and what it meant for future mergers and acquisitions, Fogel said he believed the eTraveli deal had broader implications, claiming “regulators are trying to make a statement and coming up with new laws and new regulations without actually having to have new laws.”\\n\\n“So we’re going to continue to build out our flight business, which has been doing very well. This is an unfortunate transaction. It will not allow us as quickly and as easily to improve the flight product that we have in this brand, particularly for people who have been pleading for a better flight experience,” said Fogel, “We want to try and promote new products and new services that benefit society. Big is not necessarily bad. If you misuse your powers, it is bad.”\\n\\nCommission Fees for Partners\\n\\nWhen pressed for his viewpoint on commissions charged to Booking.com partners, Fogel believed it all came down to choice and that Booking.com was not in a “dominant position.”\\n\\n“If we charge too much, nobody buys our service. It’s that simple,” said Fogel, “If I went to a hotel and said we’d like to have 60%, 70% commission. You know what they’d say? Go away. They’d look at the market and say I can use anybody. If you run get to choose who you want to use and when you want to use them.”\\n\\n“It is not a surprising observation that when it is high season, third-party distributors get fewer rooms than they do when it’s low season. If we’re not giving you value, don’t use our service… If you don’t like the price, don’t use it,” said Fogel.\\n\\nNew York STR Regulation ‘Too Draconian’\\n\\nCommenting on New York City’s new regulation for short term rentals that sees hosts needing to be licensed and present during a stay of less than 30 days, Fogel said it was a complex situation with many stakeholders but felt it was “too draconian.”\\n\\n“The way New York City has done it is one way to do it. Maybe there are other ways. Maybe there’s better zoning that could work it out better for everybody. But every municipality that has a large influx of tourists, we have to work these issues out,” said Fogel. “There are competing interests here. And sometimes you say, well, how about just the price? Why don’t we just put in a really big tourist tax on it? But then only people who have more money do that visit. And maybe that’s not fair, either. So I’m glad I’m not a politician.”\\n\\n“We have a responsibility to participate and try to make sure that this is what is the optimal solution for all the stakeholders,” said Fogel.\\n\\nSkift Global Forum 2023 Coverage\"],\n",

Popular platforms include OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, Google\\'s Bard and Microsoft\\'s Bing.\\n\\nBoth Expedia and Booking have employed generative AI in the form of customer-facing chatbots. In April, Expedia beta launched a trip-planning experience powered by ChatGPT that offers recommendations, such as where to go, where to stay and what to see in a destination.\\n\\nBooking\\'s brands have introduced several generative AI chatbots: At the top of the funnel, Booking.com\\'s AI trip planner provides recommendations; at the end of the funnel, Priceline\\'s Penny answers travel-related questions once a customer has reached the checkout page.\\n\\nOther Booking brands are looking to use generative AI in different ways. OpenTable and Kayak are experimenting with AI plug-ins, and Agoda is applying the technology internally for coding.\\n\\nExpedia\\'s generative AI chatbot launched earlier this year. Photo Credit: Expedia Group\\n\\nDespite the opportunities, both CEOs were cautiously enthusiastic.\\n\\n\"While we are excited by these new advances at Booking.com and Priceline, it is, of course, still very early days, and we have much more to learn about how customers will ultimately want to interact with this new technology,\" Fogel said.\\n\\nKern offered a similar take. Expedia has some customers who like interacting with its chatbot, and others who don\\'t. Its impact on conversion has been \"basically de minimis\" at the moment, according to Kern, but he believes it has \"a ton of promise\" as the technology evolves.\\n\\n\"I think the future, though, lies much more in a better integration, which will come as more large language models come out and we figure out how to embrace them with our own data,\" he said. \"Right now, they kind of live separately.\"\\n\\nAt Booking Holdings, Fogel\\'s vision has long been a \"connected trip\" offering customers the ability to book and adjust their entire trip in one place.

(CCL -2.11%) continues to bounce back from the pandemic\\'s impact.\\n\\nThat\\'s the take from JPMorgan Chase analysts, anyway. The bank\\'s research arm upgraded the stock to a rating of overweight earlier this week, citing an uninterrupted recovery in demand. Bank of America followed suit, upgrading Carnival shares to a buy. Both banks also upped their expectations of Carnival rivals Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH -1.33%) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL -0.08%). The bullish calls hold water, too.\\n\\nSmart investors, however, will take a step back from these bullish arguments and apply their underpinnings to the entire leisure and travel sector. Online travel agents like Booking Holdings (BKNG 0.13%) and Expedia Group (EXPE -2.06%) are riding the same bullish tide, along with several other related tickers.\\n\\nFull steam ahead\\n\\nJPMorgan\\'s explanation is straightforward enough. The firm\\'s latest call on cruise stocks reads:\\n\\nThe twofold takeaway from the \"Big 3\" [cruise lines\\' first quarter reports] was (1) bullish tone on current trends (& 1H24 bookings), with zero signs of momentum slowing (& no change in historical lead indicators), as pent-up loyalist demand a year ago transitions to new-to-cruise strength today, and (2) increased balance sheet flexibility w/ ample liquidity for debt paydown (& no plans for equity issuance across the Big 3).\\n\\nThat upgrade follows Royal Caribbean CEO Jason Liberty\\'s recent comment, \"We continue to see the ability to raise price in the current market.\" And in March, Carnival disclosed that its first-quarter future bookings reached record levels.\\n\\nIt\\'s not just an isolated tailwind, though. The entire leisure and travel business is having a moment, despite what appears to be an economic headwind.\\n\\nTake numbers from hotel market research outfit STR. The organization reports worldwide per-room revenue is now higher for 85% of hotels than it was in pre-pandemic 2019, with half of all markets reporting greater occupancy rates now than the occupancy rates seen then.\\n\\nIn this same vein, Booking\\'s CEO Glenn Fogel noted in the company\\'s first-quarter earnings report, \"We saw a strong start to the year, with first-quarter room nights and gross bookings reaching our highest quarterly levels ever, and both metrics surpassing our previous expectations.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the International Air Transport Association reports April\\'s air travel reached 90% of pre-pandemic demand, with domestic travel already eclipsing pre-pandemic norms (meaning people are traveling a great deal within their home countries).\\n\\nAnd this broad strength matters.\\n\\nWere it just demand for cruises in a firm economic environment, the brisk demand for cruises might not be built to last. But, given all the demand for leisure travel still pent-up from the COVID-19 pandemic, it\\'s conceivable that interest in travel could remain robust even through a recession. As Expedia CEO Peter Kern explained in an interview with Bloomberg a month ago, \"There are still things people can do now that they haven\\'t been able to do in the past three years.\"\\n\\nBrace for volatility that\\'s well worth it\\n\\nAlthough Carnival, Booking Holdings, and a slew of other travel-related stocks may be confirmed buys now, don\\'t be too quick to plow in. Rather, think strategically.\\n\\nCarnival\\'s upgrade catapulted the stock higher after logging more than a 40% gain last month. The stock\\'s current price is well above its current consensus target of $11.35. Norwegian Cruise Line shares are also trading above their average target price. If you\\'re going to dive in, at least wait for calmer waters.\\n\\nJust don\\'t wait too long for any of these names. Carnival and Norwegian Cruise stock may never fully peel back to their respective targets. Rather, the rest of the analyst community may follow JPMorgan\\'s and BofA\\'s lead and start inching their price targets upward. In the meantime, Expedia and Booking Holdings are both still trading below analysts\\' collective targets, and both are still riding the same bullish wave.\\n\\nConnect the dots: There\\'s something happening here in defiance of all the economic red flags. The demand for leisure travel is real. The pricing power Royal Caribbean\\'s CEO is touting only bolsters the bullish case.'],\n",

But for established companies like Booking.com, the slow and steady approach may be best.\\n\\nA task force at Booking.com is dedicated to exploring how generative AI could be integrated into the platform, but just to be clear — the company is not rushing into anything.\\n\\n“There’s certainly a place for it at Booking.com. We’re sure of that,” said Rob Francis, chief technology officer of online travel agency Booking.com, owned by Booking Holdings.\\n\\nIntentional about not succumbing to the “frenzy” around the emerging type of AI, however, the company wants to avoid releasing technology before it is ready or has a real purpose, he said.\\n\\n“We’re certainly kicking the tires and seeing what sort of great experiences we could bring to our customers with generative AI. We see some opportunities already,” Francis said. “Right now, what’s most pressing to me is to make sure that when we hit on the thing that’s right, that we can do it incredibly well, while maintaining trust with our customers.”\\n\\nFrancis is scheduled as a speaker at the upcoming Skift Future of Lodging Forum in London on March 29.\\n\\nHe declined to share specifics about how or when the generative AI will be integrated into the Booking.com platform. He did say, however, that he sees a sweet spot around using the technology to better understand exactly what a user is looking for when entering the Booking.com platform.\\n\\n“Our ability to marry up the intent of a traveler, or one of our partners, with what our platform can bring to them is where we see a big opportunity,” Francis said. “We are a two-sided marketplace, and so our ability to actually help connect both sides and bring value to that intent, I think is going to go much further into our experience. It’s just a little too early to say what that’s going to look like.”\\n\\nHe also pointed to the potential use of voice assistant technology, which got a lot of hype in the beginning that eventually died because of how frustrating voice tech can be to use. But there could be a new opportunity for it, as other experts have said.\\n\\n“I think that starts to get much more interesting with some of these capabilities.”\\n\\nWhile Booking.com is moving slowly, Trip.com has taken the opposite approach with the recent release of a generative AI chatbot called TripGen. The company is gathering information from user interactions as the product development team explores how to further implement the technology into its main platform.\\n\\nAt Booking.com, there are several issues that the company is addressing as developers explore and test the technology.\\n\\nA lot can go wrong with the technology at this point. An example of that was seen when Bard, Google’s new generative AI chatbot, gave inaccurate information during its first demo. Francis wants to make sure something like that does not happen with Booking.com.\\n\\nOne of the issues is the concern of privacy as companies are handling larges swaths of data. There have already been issues, like when one platform accidentally disclosed a patient’s medical records\\n\\nThere’s also the issue of ethics and transparency, making sure there is no bias creeping into the AI models, as has been documented in the past. The company already has been working on an initiative surrounding AI models of any kind in conjunction with other organizations.\\n\\n“If you think about even just where we are in the industry around the transparency and worrying about bias creeping into models, that’s something that everybody has to do better at.\\n\\nAnother issue: the need for more computing power means using more energy, so there needs to also be a focus on developing efficient algorithms, he said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, companies like Hopper and Expedia, as well as some startups, have shared some information about their own plans and concerns.\\n\\nOne of the top issues right now is the limited data that powers OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and many generative AI initiatives at other companies. The data is based on information from 2021, and it lacks details, like a restaurant’s hours of operation.\\n\\nThat’s where companies like Trip.com are trying to integrate the tech into its own systems of information. Until the data can be constantly updated, it won’t be much use to consumers.\\n\\n“The freshness of the information is very important,” said Amy Wei, senior director of product management for Trip.com Group, in an interview in early March. “That’s the part where we are trying to combine our technology … maybe the flight schedule or the latest hotel rate, to help people further ease their step to booking.\\n\\nDespite all of the hype and the concerns and bumps in the road, Francis does believe generative AI is here to stay.\\n\\n“I think it will ripple pretty deep through everybody’s tech stack over time,” he said. “I think there are other things that haven’t even been contemplated yet.”\\n\\nBut that time is not here yet, and he wants to make sure the Booking.com platform gets there successfully.\\n\\n“We’ve just got too many customers, and I really do obsess about that. We have to maintain a sterling reputation of trust,” Francis said. “It’s easy to lose credibility if you put something out too soon that underwhelms or doesn’t work.”'],\n",

This is illustrated by some budget airlines slashing prices to get more people to buy tickets.\\n\\nAirbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG), and Expedia Group, which all demonstrated a massive pandemic rebound through surging revenue, are all posting slowing growth now.\\n\\nAirlines are mixed, with budget carriers saying they\\'re not filling seats, while larger airlines say demand is still healthy. Delta Air Lines reported third-quarter results last week that showed strong demand, higher revenue, and increasing profits.\\n\\nBooking Holdings, which runs a platform similar to Airbnb but includes hotels and other kinds of accommodations, is still the leader of the travel platform pack, with $19 billion in trailing-12-month earnings. It\\'s also posting the fastest revenue growth: 27% in the second quarter vs. 18% for Airbnb. But both of these increases are much lower than previous quarters, and management is warning of continued strength, but further deceleration.\\n\\nSo although all of these stocks are up in 2023, they\\'re all down over the past three months, as are other travel stocks like Delta and Carnival Corp.\\n\\nLower prices create opportunities\\n\\nWall Street is clearly disappointed in the future of travel, at least for the short term. But investing for the long term is all about finding great stocks to buy at fair prices, and dips can create compelling investing opportunities. It\\'s precisely the negative market sentiment that provides the conditions to find bargain stocks.\\n\\nAll of these stocks are trading significantly below their three-year averages.\\n\\nNear-term prices will reflect short-term trends\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t mean every investor should jump into a basket of travel stocks right now although some people might want to take that very approach.\\n\\nHowever, investors can determine which stocks are likely to rebound over time and provide years of long-term gains. Booking Holdings is growing quickly and sporting an attractive valuation, but Airbnb may have a more expanded business and therefore more growth opportunities.\\n\\nLong term, many travel stocks can support high gains for patient investors. Short term, they might go sideways or even trend downward as sales slow. But you can\\'t time the market, so you if you can identify a stock with opportunity, you can consider buying now.\\n\\nFind out why Booking Holdings is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\\n\\nOur analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market.

       " datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 5, 0, 0): [\"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Booking Holdings (BKNG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\\n\\nThis online booking service has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 14.33%.\\n\\nFor the most recent quarter, Booking Holdings was expected to post earnings of $10.48 per share, but it reported $11.60 per share instead, representing a surprise of 10.69%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $20.97 per share, while it actually produced $24.74 per share, a surprise of 17.98%.\\n\\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Booking Holdings. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\\n\\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nBooking Holdings has an Earnings ESP of +1.16% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 3, 2023.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\\n\\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\\n\\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

As these things go, that's ample motivation to improve performance.\\n\\nIn monitoring online travel CEO compensation packages over the years, it’s always interesting to see these leaders receive what may be looked at as lifetime achievement awards, a monetary “thank you.” At long last, it’s time to cash in.\\n\\nIn 2013, some observers might have been taken aback when Tripadvisor co-founder and then-CEO Steve Kaufer commanded total compensation of $39 million, only to be followed by another $48 million in 2017. That turned out to be small compared with Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky’s $120 million total compensation package in 2020. Even more dramatic was Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern’s compensation package of close to $300 million in 2021.\\n\\nThe pay packages for 2022 are a tad smaller – and may seem outrageous to some.\\n\\nThe online travel boss with the largest award in 2022 was Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel. He got close to $31 million, a 404:1 ratio to the median employee at the company.\\n\\nSonder’s Francis Davidson, was number two, with $21.6 million, including $20.1 million in stock awards. Davidson co-founded the hospitality company, has served as CEO since 2014, and took the company public in a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, deal in January 2022.\\n\\nBut its stock price, $8.95 at the IPO, finished the year at $1.42. In 2023 — which didn’t have any bearing on the 2022 package — Sonder faces a potential delisting from the Nasdaq.\\n\\nMuch of the compensation we’re discussing is theoretical, potentially earned over the coming years, and contingent on reaching certain performance targets.\\n\\n10 Largest Online Travel Pay Packages 2022\\n\\nRank Executive Company Title 2022 Pay Package 1. Glenn Fogel Booking Holdings CEO $30.78 million 2. Francis Davidson Sonder CEO $21.6 million 3. Julie Whalen Expedia CFO $16.4 million 4. Matt Goldberg Tripadvisor CEO $14.5 million 5. Rob Greyber Vacasa CEO $13.3 million 6. David Goulden Booking Holdings CFO $12.12 million 7. Peter Millones Booking Holdings General Counsel $11.16 millon 8.. Aristotle Balogh Airbnb CTO $10.6 million 9. Dave Stephenson Airbnb CFO $10.1 million 10. Catherine Powell Airbnb Head of Hosting $9.5 million\\n\\nSource: Skift/public filings\\n\\nA Wall Street Journal-commissioned study found that the majority of CEOs’ payola in 2022 turned out to be considerably smaller than previously valued, a trend not seen for 10 years or so.\\n\\n“The numbers show that in 2022 about two-thirds of the top executives at S&P 500 companies ended the year with smaller pay packages than they were awarded, at least on paper,” the story said.\\n\\nAsked about Davidson’s compensation package given the company’s struggles, the company said: “Performance awards accounted for over 90 percent of our total CEO compensation in 2022, and they only start to actualize when our stock price goes above $13 per share. A dollar value is assigned to performance awards for accounting purposes, but our CEO only benefits when the stock price goes above $13 per share and other shareholders benefit.”\\n\\nSonder closed trading Friday at $0.65 per share so Davidson will have an enormous hurdle to actually receive the value of his compensation award.\\n\\nGlenn Fogel Was Top Boss\\n\\nThe package for Fogel from Booking Holdings, which touts Booking.com, Kayak and Priceline among its brands, was a comedown from his 2021 package of $54 million.\\n\\nIf you’d invested $100 in Booking’s stock at the end of 2019, the total shareholder return would have been $98.13 compared with $81.50 for what Booking considers to be its peer group.\\n\\nBooking generated more than $3 billion in net income in 2022, although the company doesn’t use these metrics to determine pay packages. Among the factors the board weighed were record revenue, gross bookings and room nights, $6.5 billion in stock repurchases, and progress in expanding in the U.S. market. Booking.com is headquartered in Amsterdam.\\n\\nCompanies in many other parts of the world don’t publicly disclose CEO compensation, but European pay packages tend to be lower than their U.S. counterparts.\\n\\nExpedia Group CFO Julie Whalen’s Pay Topped CEOs of Tripadvisor and Vacasa\\n\\nAmong other highlights of the 2022 compensation packages: Expedia Group Chief Financial Officer Julie Whalen was awarded $16.4 million – $15.8 million of which was in performance-based stock awards.\\n\\nThat was larger than two new CEOs in 2022: Matt Goldberg of Tripadvisor and Rob Greyber of Vacasa.\\n\\n“Upon her appointment as Expedia Group’s Chief Financial Officer on September 26, 2022, Ms. Whalen’s stock target was established at 17,342 shares (3x salary) until the next measurement date,” a financial filing stated. “Ms. Whalen has not yet met her target and therefore she is currently subject to the holdback.”\\n\\nExpedia Group CEO Peter Kern’s total compensation package in 2022 was a relatively modest $1.1 million, but that followed his close to $300 million award in 2021.\\n\\nDon’t Shed Tears for Brian Chesky’s Compensation\\n\\nLike Kern of Expedia, Airbnb’s Brian Chesky didn’t make the 2022 top 10 list, with a mere $311,000 award, down from $120 million in 2020.\\n\\nIf you’d invested $100 in Airbnb stock when it went public on December 10, 2020, Airbnb calculated that investment would have been worth $143 at the end of 2022.\\n\\nAirbnb Chief Technology Officer Aristotle Balogh, Chief Financial Officer David Stephenson, and Global Head of Hosting Catherine Powell all got compensation packages of around $10 million in 2022.\\n\\nThat put them in the top 10 and ahead of packages for Barry Diller, the Expedia Group chairman ($8 million) and Airbnb co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Nathan Blecharczyk ($7.6 million).\"],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 10, 0, 0): [\"Online travel agencies are taking back some of the distribution market share they lost to hotel chains during the years leading up to the pandemic, as companies such as Expedia Group and Priceline parent Booking Holdings have ramped up marketing investment and product improvements to sell more room nights to prospective U.S. lodging guests.\\n\\nDirect-booking incentives and loyalty program pushes have made strides in driving guests to book on the websites of the big hotel brands. But as the industry's recovery from the pandemic has progressed, OTA bookings have again outpaced hotel website bookings.\\n\\nAccording to travel-research firm Phocuswright, online travel agencies' share of bookings dropped to as low as 49% before the pandemic, but has since rebounded to 52%. In 2012, OTAs had a 54% share of that business.\\n\\nWhile such gains appear incremental, one percentage point of online gross bookings can account for as much as $1 billion worth of business and anywhere between $100 million and $200 million in commissions swapped between the hotel companies and OTAs.\\n\\n“It became easy and cheaper if you were a member of a loyalty program to book direct, but that’s been countered by [OTAs’] marketing programs, and hotels can’t compete with that,” said Lorraine Sileo, senior analyst at Phocuswright. “When things ramped back up in 2022, the OTAs hit it hard and gained share back.”\\n\\nExecutives at both Expedia and Booking Holdings indicated in recent earnings calls that the momentum has carried over into this year.\\n\\nExpedia’s total lodging bookings increased 38% year over year in 2022, and the company reported record fourth-quarter bookings last year. Expedia CEO Peter Kern, speaking on the company’s earnings call in February, partly attributed the gains to investment in integrating its Hotels.com site into Expedia’s booking platform.\\n\\n“In January, we saw a step change where our lodging gross bookings accelerated even further, growing over 20% versus 2019,” Expedia Chief Financial Officer Julie Whalen said on February’s call. “While it is still early in the quarter in 2023, we are pleased to see strong lodging demand continue.”\\n\\nThe number of rooms booked on Booking Holdings’ channels increased 52% last year to almost 900 million, an annual record for the company.\\n\\n“On our volume and consumer spend basis, we have grown our U.S. business to be meaningfully larger than it was prior to the pandemic,” said Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel on the company’s earnings call in February. “We believe that our growth rate has outpaced the recovery in the broader market for U.S. accommodations, which means we believe we gained market share.”\\n\\nAnalysts say the tug-of-war for online hotel bookings between the chains and OTAs began in earnest during the early 2000s and intensified in the years following the Great Recession, when hoteliers scrambling for guests offered more rooms to OTAs at discounts of as much as 25% relative to the retail rate. Additionally, tech-savvy leaders of OTAs created and tweaked booking platforms that were often more user-friendly than hotel websites.\\n\\n“Sometimes, making the first move in technology is everything,” said Mehmet Erdem, associate professor of hotel operations and technology at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Historically, we know that the hotel industry has blinked and let third-party intermediaries take a large share of the market.”\\n\\nBy 2016, though, that market share was shifting in the other direction toward hotels, as lodging companies beefed up loyalty program marketing and started offering lowest-price guarantees and other perks for members who booked rooms directly. Additionally, hotel companies became more adept at creating simpler online booking processes on their websites.\\n\\n“There’s been a lot of progress made by Brand.com,” Erdem said. “If you counted how many mouse clicks it’d take [to book a room], it’d take as many as 30 steps. Accor’s brought it down to five clicks.”\\n\\nDuring the pandemic, direct bookings were driven in part by guests who had questions only someone at the hotel could answer.\\n\\n“People wanted to book direct because they needed to know if the pool or restaurant was open,” Sileo said.\\n\\nAs travel and hotel booking patterns have normalized, in some ways relationships have improved between the hotel companies and OTAs.\\n\\nSileo said OTAs have been willing to pay a little more in commissions to the hotels they list, while the discounts hotel companies are giving the intermediaries are ranging from 8% by the larger chains to about 20% by the independent properties.\\n\\n“The relationship between the OTAs and chains has definitely improved, and the chains feel like they have a lot more negotiating power,” Sileo said. “There is so much strength in the hotel market in general. Even if they lose a little share, they’re still growing at a healthy clip.”\\n\\nAnother economic crisis, such as a global recession forecast for the second half of 2023, could upend that relationship again — or not.\\n\\n“In the past, a weak economy has helped the OTAs because of all of the deals,” Sileo said. “But hotels have made so much progress that it may not repeat itself.”\\n\\nReturn to the Hotel News Now homepage.\"],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 7, 0, 0): [\"Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) has recently witnessed a daily gain of 5.55%, with a 3-month gain of 25.15%. The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stand at 115.79. These figures raise the question: Is the stock modestly undervalued? This article aims to answer this question through a detailed valuation analysis of Booking Holdings. We invite readers to delve into our findings.\\n\\nCompany Overview\\n\\nBooking Holdings is the world's largest online travel agency by revenue, offering a plethora of booking and payment services. These range from hotel and alternative accommodation rooms to airline tickets, rental cars, restaurant reservations, cruises, experiences, and other vacation packages. The company operates several branded travel booking sites, including Booking.com, Agoda, OpenTable, and Rentalcars.com. With the acquisitions of Kayak and Momondo, Booking Holdings has also expanded into travel media. The bulk of the company's revenue and profits stem from transaction fees for online bookings.\\n\\nAt its current stock price of $3233.26 per share, Booking Holdings has a market capitalization of $115.40 billion. When compared to its fair value (GF Value) of $3802.12, the stock appears to be modestly undervalued.\\n\\nIs Booking Holdings (BKNG) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Analysis\\n\\nGF Value Explained\\n\\nThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is derived from a unique method that considers historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line, displayed on our summary page, gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at.\\n\\nAccording to our analysis, Booking Holdings appears to be modestly undervalued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIs Booking Holdings (BKNG) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Analysis\\n\\nLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.\\n\\nFinancial Strength\\n\\nInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding to buy its stock. A great starting point for understanding a company's financial strength is looking at its cash-to-debt ratio. Booking Holdings has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.05, which is better than 62.15% of companies in the Travel & Leisure industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Booking Holdings at 6 out of 10, indicating that it's fair.\\n\\nIs Booking Holdings (BKNG) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Analysis\\n\\nProfitability and Growth\\n\\nIt is less risky to invest in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. Booking Holdings has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $19.30 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $115.79. Its operating margin is 30.05%, which ranks better than 92.28% of companies in the Travel & Leisure industry. Overall, the profitability of Booking Holdings is ranked 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.\\n\\nOne of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Booking Holdings is 7.2%, which ranks better than 71.9% of companies in the Travel & Leisure industry. However, the 3-year average EBITDA growth is -8%, which ranks worse than 67.16% of companies in the Travel & Leisure industry.\\n\\nROIC vs WACC\\n\\nAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Booking Holdings's ROIC was 34.47, while its WACC came in at 12.28.\\n\\nIs Booking Holdings (BKNG) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Analysis\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, the stock of Booking Holdings appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks worse than 67.16% of companies in the Travel & Leisure industry.

       " datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 8, 0, 0): ['Booking.com and Airbnb are tough to compare. Although Booking.com officials would admit it has a lot to improve in short-term rentals, the company is playing its hotel hand to an advantage.\\n\\nIn an era when travelers see short-term rentals as an ever-more attractive choice, Booking.com’s mix of bookings for these types of accommodations on its platforms in the third quarter ticked up just “slightly” compared with 2019 to around 30 percent, the company said. Isn’t this an historic failure? Shouldn’t Booking.com be gaining more ground?\\n\\nOK, these were trick questions.\\n\\nAlthough CEO Glenn Fogel isn’t necessarily pleased with the pace of expanding the company’s roster of what he calls “alternative accommodations” — it added 300,000 since 2021 — he doesn’t mind the fact that around 70 percent of bookings on the site, around the same as a year earlier, were for hotels because they are more profitable than short-term rental stays.\\n\\n“Well, I mean, we could easily increase that if we didn’t do so well in hotels,” Fogel said last week in response to an analyst’s question during parent company Booking Holdings’ third quarter earnings discussion. Fogel is CEO of both the parent company and Booking.com.\\n\\nHe added that it isn’t part of Booking.com’s strategy to push travelers toward short-term rentals versus hotels. Giving them a choice is a competitive advantage, he argued. After all, Airbnb doesn’t offer an extensive collection of hotels for people who prefer that sort of stay, depending on their mood or trip type.\\n\\n“So I don’t see anything to try and artificially try and drive more people to the alternative accommodations, so necessarily a thing that’s going to increase the value of the company,” Fogel said. “I think providing the customer with what they want, what they need, what they think is best for them is really the right way being consumer-centric and really driving that is the best way to build the company.”\\n\\nBooking.com’s adjusted earnings (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) was $2.7 billion in the third quarter, a 26 percent year over year jump.\\n\\nBooking.com Versus Priceline\\n\\nAnother tidbit from Booking’s quarterly report that stood out was its brand strategy in the U.S., and globally.\\n\\nFogel pointed to sister brands Priceline and Booking.com both performing well in the U.S. — a focus area for potential growth — and contributing to a nearly 30 percent increase in room nights in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2019.\\n\\nBut wouldn’t it be more efficient cost-wise to eliminate one of those brands in the U.S. to quash the existence of multiple teams doing similar functions at Priceline and Booking.com, and even at times competing against one another?\\n\\nAfter all, rival Expedia Group has been hell-bent under CEO Peter Kern to eliminate duplicative teams in a bid to simplify its overall operation.\\n\\n“Some of our competitors have done that,” Fogel acknowledged. “And to me, that may be their strategy. Our strategy is to continue with the differentiation among these brands and continue to build them out the way they’re doing them.”\\n\\nHe declined to cite details about Amsterdam-based Booking.com’s performance in the U.S. versus that of Connecticut-headquartered Priceline.\\n\\n“We have different brands because they offer a different user experience to the consumer and the different things that they are aiming to do different strategies,” Fogel said. “We really — we totally understand the issue of are we causing excess cost. Are there ways to save money by doing things that are not duplicative? So we are — we understand that. We are working all the time looking at those things that we can try and improve upon.”\\n\\nSo for Booking Holdings, it is sticking with Booking.com, Priceline, and metasearch brand Kayak in the U.S.\\n\\nThe parent company has done similar things in other regions where, for example in various Asian countries, Booking.com and Agoda tend to compete against one another.'],\n",
       " datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 9, 0, 0): [\"Kayak isn't as muscular today in metasearch, as some would have forecast years ago, given the impact of Google. But Kayak hasn't folded, either.\\n\\nEditor’s Note: Every Wednesday, Executive Editor and online travel rockstar Dennis Schaal will bring readers exclusive reporting and insight into the business of online travel and digital booking, and how this sector has an impact across the travel industry.\\n\\nOnline Travel This Week\\n\\nTen years ago this week, on November 9, 2012, the Priceline Group (today’s Booking Holdings) announced a deal to acquire Kayak, the Connecticut-based metasearch engine, which had been a public company for less than four months.\\n\\n“A bomb just dropped in the online travel world: Priceline the world’s largest travel company, has agreed to acquire travel meta-search company Kayak, for about $1.8 billion,” wrote Skift founder Rafat Ali, adding, “Priceline will gain a great online and mobile team to build its portfolio and will put muscle behind the Kayak brand.” After regulatory scrutiny, Priceline welcomed Kayak into the fold on May 21, 2013.\\n\\nTo understand the context, Kayak was among the hottest things in U.S. online travel in those days, although Google had acquired flight-tech company ITA Software in 2011.\\n\\nWhen Kayak, which was co-founded in 2004 by Steve Hafner and Paul English, went public on Nasdaq on July 20, 2012, Skift published a blog with around 18 updates documenting every move that day. When the closing bell clanged on its initial trading day, Kayak’s share price had increased 26 percent to $33.18, while 70 percent of Nasdaq’s other listings headed downward.\\n\\nSo what has been the outcome for Kayak so far under Booking Holdings, and in an era when Google’s fight and hotel metasearch products have established a global footprint and sucked some of the life out of numerous competitors? From a financial standpoint, It’s tough to say with certainty because Booking doesn’t reveal much about Kayak’s earnings.\\n\\nAsked about Kayak’s fate under Booking Holdings over the last nine-plus years, Kayak CEO Hafner told Skift: “We don’t report numbers, but I can assure you that our business has prospered since the acquisition. Booking Holdings has supported our international expansion (from 14 countries to over 40), mergers and acquisitions (more than $550 million for Momondo and Hotelscombined), and anything else that we’ve tried like Kayak Miami Beach.”\\n\\nKayak/Booking Holdings acquired metasearch companies Momondo in 2017 and Hotelscombined in 2018. In partnership with hotel operator Life House, there are now three Kayak-branded hotels, one in Miami Beach, Florida, and two in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.\\n\\n“If it hadn’t worked, I still wouldn’t be at Kayak,” Hafner said, contrasting his tenure of 18 years or so at Kayak with leadership changes over the years at Expedia-controlled Trivago and Trip.com Group-owned Skyscanner.\\n\\nOne person close to Kayak, who has some knowledge of Kayak’s financials, said “they continue to crush it.”\\n\\nGoogle has certainly adversely impacted Kayak’s stature. And at times one has to question whether Booking Holdings could be committing more advertising and marketing dollars to keep Kayak front and center in travelers’ trip-planning considerations. In 2015, then-Priceline Group CEO Darren Huston even questioned the value of metasearch, although his own company, now called Booking Holdings, already owned Kayak; Expedia had a majority stake in Trivago; and Trip.com Group acquired Skyscanner the next year, in 2016.\\n\\n“The Google threat is real,” said Kayak co-founder Paul English, who left the company in late 2013. “I wonder if there will ever be any antitrust against Google for taking over search results vertical by vertical, and starving what were previously strong companies.”\\n\\nEnglish added that rivals such as Tripadvisor, which is currently formulating a turnaround plan, “were much more vulnerable than Kayak, since I think most of TripAdvisor’s traffic was SEO (search engine optimization), where most of Kayak’s traffic was self-directed.”\\n\\nEnglish said he’s disappointed that Kayak hasn’t done more with taking direct bookings, especially mobile ones. “It is so harsh to do a search in the Kayak app, and then when I find what I want, I have to open another app and start all over again,” he said.\\n\\nMartin Lumbye, the CEO of North East Venture, was one of four people who launched Momondo in 2006. He left Momondo in 2014, and Kayak acquired it three years later.\\n\\nLumbye said Momondo’s front end doesn’t appear to have undergone any radical changes in recent years, but he believes its back-end technology is likely faster and deeper.\\n\\n“The biggest developments probably lie in the access to capital needed to scale internationally, and the ability to have more power in negotiations with online travel agencies and airlines regarding the costs per click they pay to Momondo and Kayak because size does matter,” Lumbye said.\\n\\nKayak, as well as Tripadvisor, used to be must-use marketing vehicles for travel companies, at least in North America. Is Kayak still important?\\n\\nClayton Reid, CEO of travel and tourism marketing company MMGY Global, said he’s surprised how well Kayak has withstood Google’s “aggressive tactics.\\n\\nKayak “is still very much relevant for travelers in our survey of travel influence” Reid said. “Kayak has certainly fared better than Tripadvisor and Trivago, with a more consistent place in the travel making decision process. The other two have tried to move more up funnel with, I would argue, poorer outcomes.”\\n\\nIn Brief\\n\\nAirbnb to Start Showing U.S. Guests Total Price Up-Front\\n\\nAirbnb will next month begin showing U.S. customers the total price of a booking, minus the taxes, up-front in its listings and on maps when they opt in to view it in that way. Under regulatory pressure, the company has done this in Europe for an extended period. Airbnb said it will also curb some hosts onerous checkout task requirements. Skift\\n\\nTripadvisor Hints at Turnaround Plan\\n\\nTripadvisor officials hinted that its Viator tours and activities brand, as well as hotel metasearch, will be anchor elements of its turnaround plan under new company leadership (new CEO and chief financial officer). Details to come in 2023. Skift\\n\\nHopper Gets More Funding From Chum Capital One, $96 Million\\n\\nWho is Hopper’s favorite distribution partner? Undoubtably it is Capital One Travel. The credit card company just contributed an additional $96 million in fundings to Hopper’s coffers as banks up their travel portal game. Skift\"]}"
