      "text/plain": "{datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 27, 9, 21): ['The past 30 years have featured no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends on Wall Street. Everything from the advent of the internet to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated investors\\' attention. But over the coming years, it\\'s the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) that could drive some of the highest and most consistent growth.\\n\\nAlthough the EV space is highly competitive, one company has become nothing short of a polarizing battleground between optimists and skeptics. I\\'m talking about Tesla (TSLA -3.13%), the world\\'s largest auto stock by market cap.\\n\\nWhile Tesla has ridden its first-mover advantages to phenomenal gains, there are some very clear reasons to completely avoid investing in this highflier.\\n\\nGiving credit where credit is due\\n\\nBefore digging into Tesla\\'s red flags, allow me to give the company credit where credit is due.\\n\\nTesla is the first automaker in well over a half-century to successfully grow from the ground up to mass production. More importantly, it\\'s the only pure-play EV maker that\\'s generating a profit on a recurring basis. Tesla has produced three consecutive years of profits, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and is three-quarters of the way to a fourth straight year.\\n\\nTesla\\'s balance sheet is also something to marvel at within the auto space. Traditionally, legacy automakers have relied on debt to finance various aspects of their production, expansion, and innovation. This has left many of the world\\'s biggest auto manufacturers with a sizable amount of debt on their balance sheets.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tesla closed out the September quarter with nearly $26.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments compared to roughly $4.4 billion in current and long-term debt and finance leases. Tesla\\'s financial flexibility is far superior to most of its competition, which is what allows CEO Elon Musk the confidence to expand production and aggressively innovate.\\n\\nAdditionally, Tesla is generating a profit from its ancillary operations. The company\\'s third-quarter results show a \"combined gross profit generation of over $0.5 [billion] in Q3\" from its Energy Generation and Storage segment, along with Services and Other operations.\\n\\nBut this Wall Street darling has a glaring problem hiding in plain sight.\\n\\nIs Tesla\\'s profit built on an unsustainable house of cards?\\n\\nI know what you\\'re probably thinking: \"He\\'s going to discuss the company\\'s declining operating margin!\" While you\\'re correct, I\\'m not ready to touch on that subject just yet.\\n\\nThe far bigger worry for Tesla is how the company is generating its profits.\\n\\nAs a high-growth, industry-leading business with a market cap that\\'s greater than virtually every other major automaker on a combined basis, the expectation would be that Tesla\\'s core operations -- selling and leasing EVs -- are driving the bulk of its profit growth. After all, the bull thesis for years has been that Tesla\\'s first-mover advantages and production efficiencies would allow it to produce EVs at a cheaper cost than legacy automakers, thus leading to a superior operating margin and a rapid ramp-up in production.\\n\\nBut this isn\\'t the case.\\n\\nThe September-ended quarter saw Tesla generate $2.045 billion in income before taxes. A whopping $554 million of this profit derived from automotive regulatory credits. Renewable energy credits are given by governments to Tesla for free, and the company is able to sell these credits at a 100% profit to other automakers who may be short of meeting certain carbon-offset requirements.\\n\\nAnother $282 million in Q3 pre-tax income can be traced to interest income on the company\\'s abundant pile of cash. Don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'m not in any way faulting Tesla or its management team for generating interest income on capital they have lying around. It\\'s a smart move.\\n\\nAll told, that\\'s $836 million of the company\\'s $2.045 billion in pre-tax income that\\'s derived from potentially unsustainable sources of profit that have absolutely nothing to do with selling or leasing EVs. In other words, 41% of the company\\'s income before taxes has a pretty big asterisk next to it.\\n\\nBut wait -- there\\'s more\\n\\nIn addition to the aforementioned 836 million reasons to be skeptical of Tesla stock, there are three even more prevalent reasons to shy away.\\n\\nThe first, as noted, is the company\\'s rapidly declining operating margin. Tesla kicked off a price war with other EV makers earlier this year and has, in the process, reduced the selling price across its four production models (Model\\'s 3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions.\\n\\nWith Musk confirming that his company\\'s pricing strategy is based on demand, these aggressive price cuts clearly signal that competition is picking up and Tesla\\'s inventory levels are rising. That\\'s not a good combination, and it perfectly explains why Tesla\\'s operating margin has been more than halved (17.2% to 7.6%) over the past year.\\n\\nThe second prevalent reason to avoid Tesla stock is Elon Musk. Though he\\'s viewed as a visionary by optimists, Musk has also proven to be a major liability for his company. He\\'s drawn the ire of securities regulators on a handful of occasions and has made countless promises with regard to innovations that haven\\'t been kept. Advances like \"full autonomous driving\" have been baked into Tesla\\'s valuation, yet the company remains no closer today to moving past Level 2 autonomy than it has over the past five years.\\n\\nThe third prevalent reason to keep your distance from Tesla stock is its valuation. If Tesla were a high-growth company with a superior operating margin to its peers, perhaps a case could be made that it deserves an otherworldly premium. But at 68 times Wall Street\\'s forecast earnings this year, a declining operating margin, and more than 40% of its income deriving from unsustainable sources that have nothing to do with the company\\'s operating model, the company\\'s valuation can\\'t be justified.\\n\\nWhile Tesla\\'s history of innovation and first-mover advantages are bound to lure some investors, there are 836 million reasons why I won\\'t be one of them.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 21, 5, 41, 3): [\"Loading...

At the time this was easy to dismiss as crackers. In the eight years since its founding in 2003 the firm had manufactured a piddling 1,650 EV s. Its first big-selling car, the Model S , had yet to hit the road.\\n\\nToday it is almost as mad to argue that Elon Musk, the carmaker’s boss since 2008, has not achieved that goal. His company, a rare insurgent in an industry with formidable barriers to entry, has grown at neck-snapping speed. In the first quarter of 2023 Tesla’s Model Y mini- SUV was the world’s bestselling car. In the second quarter it delivered a total of 466,000 cars, beating analysts’ forecasts (see chart 1). Mr Musk’s promise of 2m sales this year, up from 1.3m in 2022, no longer seems fanciful. On July 15th the first Cybertruck, an angular, retro-futuristic pickup, rolled off the production line. Tesla has just unveiled an expansion plan for its German factory, where it wants to double capacity to 1m vehicles per year.\\n\\nBesides almost single-handedly reimagining the car, Mr Musk has done the same to the car industry. His focus on streamlined manufacturing of only a handful of models has kept costs at bay. Last year Tesla boasted operating margins of 17%; among non-niche carmakers only Porsche, which churns out fewer than 1m cars annually, matched its performance.\\n\\nMr Musk’s ambition to dominate the auto business—by making 20m cars a year by 2030, double the current output of today’s top manufacturer, Toyota, and by creating the go-to self-driving system—certainly compels investors, who value Tesla at around $900bn. That is down from over $1trn in early 2022 but still more than the next nine most valuable carmakers put together. Incumbents are scrambling to electrify their product ranges and to copy Mr Musk’s vertically integrated approach to production, while fending off a wave of EV newcomers, many of them Chinese, all trying to be the next Tesla.\\n\\nThe question now is whether Tesla can keep growing as fast and as profitably as it has for much longer. In its latest quarterly earnings on July 19th, it reported margins of 9.6%, even lower than the 11.4% it eked out in the three previous months, as it slashed prices in order to compete with cheaper rivals (see chart 2). Its advantages as a disruptive tech firm with a Silicon Valley mindset are in danger of being eroded. To make even 5m-6m cars a year this decade, a more realistic target than Mr Musk’s goal of 20m, would require “embracing the techniques of legacy auto”, observes Dan Levy of Barclays, a bank. In order to remain a disruptive force, Tesla may, paradoxically, need to become a bit more like the stodgy car business it has shaken up.\\n\\nTesla maintains a lead over its more established rivals in batteries, software and manufacturing productivity, notes Philippe Houchois of Jefferies, an investment bank. But competitors are catching up. In some areas, like marketing and product planning, they have overtaken it, notes Mr Houchois. When it launched the Model S —large and pricey with big batteries and a long range—it had the EV market largely to itself. Nowadays motorists can choose between 500 or so EV models from dozens of marques. Bernstein, a broker, estimates that around 220 new models may be launched this year and another 180 in 2024 (chart 3). For Tesla to grow fast in the face of all this competition will be difficult.\\n\\nUnlike incumbent carmakers’ “something for everybody” approach, Tesla manufactures just five models (if you count the Cybertruck) and relies heavily on two of them. The Model 3, a small saloon, and the Model Y account for 95% of the vehicles Tesla shifts. By comparison, Toyota’s two bestsellers, Corolla and RAV 4, make up just 18% of the vehicles sold by the Japanese firm. For Tesla to hit its target of selling a combined 3m-4m Model 3s and Model Y s, each model would need to control 50% of the cars in its class ($40,000-60,000 mass-market cars and $45,000-65,000 SUV s, respectively). According to Bernstein, no carmaker has ever had more than 10% in those two segments.\\n\\nOff the marque\\n\\nAnd both models are ageing. The Model Y is three years old and the Model 3 has just turned six, which makes them less desirable in a business where novelty has historically counted for a lot. Carmaking’s rule of thumb to keep sales chugging along is to refresh models every 2-4 years and redesign them completely every 4-7 years. Tesla’s planned “refresh” of the Model 3’s styling and its tech innards this year looks late by industry standards.\\n\\nThe company will need to go well beyond its current strategy, of offering software updates that improve some of its cars’ features, or that add new ones. This may have done the trick for its original customer base of early-adopter techies but is unlikely to cut it with the average motorist. One solution is to offer more options for its existing range. Barclays estimates that the Model 3 comes in 180 configurations, a fraction of the 195,000 trims for a comparable (petrol-powered) BMW 3 Series saloon. But this would introduce the sort of complexity Mr Musk has hitherto shunned.\\n\\nAnother route to higher sales is to launch new models, like the Cybertruck or a low-cost mass-market vehicle—unofficially called the “Model 2” and with prices starting at $25,000—which Mr Musk has promised to start selling in the next couple of years. New models, though, come with new challenges. The relevant pickup market, with global sales of 1.3m, according to Bernstein, is relatively modest—and the Cybertruck’s bold styling may limit its appeal. And though low-cost Teslas could expand the company’s market beyond America, China and Europe, they would almost certainly generate lower margins, further depressing the company’s overall profitability. Moreover, granting regional ventures greater autonomy to manage regional differences in taste, as established carmakers have historically done, again adds complexity and costs.\\n\\nMr Musk may no longer be able to avoid other expensive industry practices. One is marketing. In contrast to all other big carmakers, which spend princely sums on ads, Tesla has depended on word-of-mouth and Mr Musk’s own larger-than-life persona to promote its products. Barclays reckons that eschewing ads and, by selling directly to buyers, bypassing dealers, currently saves the company $2,500-4,000 for every car it sells. As it seeks new customers, and as Mr Musk risks affecting Tesla sales with his polarising stewardship of Twitter, his $44bn side-project, the company is likely to forgo some of those savings. Mr Musk has conceded as much, saying that, for the first time, his company might “try a little advertising”.\\n\\nAnother carmaking staple to which Tesla has belatedly come around is price cuts. Mr Musk had pledged never to offer discounts or allow inventory to build up. His company has lately done both. Production exceeded sales in the past five quarters. After growing at an average annual rate of 60% for years, quarterly sales volumes expanded by an average of 30-40% between the second quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. To shift more vehicles Mr Musk began slashing prices late last year, by up to 25% on some models. Sales duly ballooned, by more than 80% in the second quarter, compared with a year ago. The flipside was those duly contracting margins. Investors have tolerated Mr Musk’s price cuts more than in the case of his rivals: on July 17th Ford’s share price fell by 6% after it announced hefty discounts on its F -150 Lightning EV pickup. They may not stay so forgiving for ever.\\n\\nAs its various costs rise, Tesla will try to keep cutting them elsewhere, notably in manufacturing. In March it unveiled what it called the “unboxed process”, designed to make cars “significantly simpler and more affordable” by streamlining or even eliminating stages of production. It is unclear what exactly Mr Musk has in mind. Despite his record of engineering ingenuity, at least one previous attempt to up-end car manufacturing, by replacing people with robots for the Model 3, led to what Mr Musk himself candidly described as “production hell” and near-bankruptcy in 2018.\\n\\nMr Musk’s last fresh challenge—and another one he shares with incumbent Western carmakers—is what to do about China. Tesla, which makes more than half its cars at its giant factory in Shanghai, no longer seems to hold its privileged position in the country. It was allowed to set up without the Chinese joint-venture partner required of other foreign carmakers, at a time when China needed Mr Musk to supply EV s for Chinese motorists and, importantly, to encourage China’s own budding EV industry to raise its game.\\n\\nThat has worked too well. Tesla is thought to have sold 155,000 cars in China in the second quarter, 13% more than in the previous three months. But China Merchants Bank International Securities, an investment firm, reckons its market share may have slipped below 14%, from 16% in the preceding quarter, as buyers switched to fast-improving home-grown brands. In a sign that Tesla now needs China more than China needs Tesla, the company was obliged to sign a pledge on July 6th with other car firms to stop its price war and compete fairly in line with “core socialist values”. Tu Le of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy, says rumours are rife that the Chinese authorities are pushing back against Tesla’s efforts to increase manufacturing capacity in China. And that is before getting into the increasingly fraught geopolitics of Sino-American commerce.\\n\\nIf Tesla is to sell 6m cars a year at an operating margin of 14% by 2030, which Mr Levy of Barclays thinks possible, it probably needs to avoid at least some of these pitfalls. It would be foolish to dismiss that eventuality, given Tesla’s knack for confounding sceptics. It could, for example, offset part of the decline in sales growth with new revenue streams, such as recent deals to open its charging network to Ford and General Motors customers. As brands become defined by the digitally mediated experience of driving rather than the body shell or handling, its superior software—including, one day, self-driving systems—may allow it to keep offering fewer models than its rivals. Mr Le thinks Tesla will mitigate the China risk by manufacturing more of its cars in Germany and other countries, including low-cost ones. Tesla has been by far the most compelling car company of the early 21st century. If it is to hold on to that title, it must work for it. ■\\n\\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.\\n\\nFor more coverage of climate change, sign up for The Climate Issue, our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our climate-change hub.',\n  'DOVER, Del. —\\n\\nCurrent and former directors of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. have agreed to return more than $735 million to the company to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging that they unjustly enriched themselves with excessive compensation.\\n\\nThe proposed settlement was outlined in documents filed late Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery and is subject to court approval. The settlement does not include claims involving any other Tesla shareholder suit, including a separate Chancery Court action challenging a compensation package awarded to CEO Elon Musk in 2018 that is potentially worth more than $55 billion. A ruling in that case is expected in the very near future.\\n\\nThe settlement agreement involves a derivative lawsuit filed on behalf of the company in 2020 by the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit, a retirement fund that invested in Tesla and challenged stock options granted to company directors starting in June 2017.\\n\\nThe settlement agreement calls for the director defendants, including Oracle co-founder and former Tesla board member Larry Ellison, to provide Tesla with the value of more than 3.1 million stock options, in the form of returned cash, returned stock and unexercised stock options. The total value is based on a settlement stock price of $260.54, which was Tesla’s closing share price on June 16.

Any fees awarded to plaintiffs’ attorneys would be deducted from the settlement amount and would reduce the amount of consideration paid to the company.\\n\\nAs part of the settlement, the director defendants also will permanently forego stock options for 2021 and 2022 and will not receive any further compensation for board service during those years. The board had previously adopted resolutions to forego until this month any automatic grants of annual stock option awards for outside directors for those years.

Tesla offered two rebates for buyers taking delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year, initially offering a $3,750 discount then doubling the rebate to $7,500 with two weeks left in 2022.\\n\\nInvestors were rattled by the rebates, sending the stock plunging 37% in December alone.\\n\\nTesla thanked customers and employees for helping the company “achieve a great 2022 in light of significant Covid and supply chain related challenges throughout the year,” according to a statement released on Monday.\\n\\nThe company also said it was proud of its growth and progress.\\n\\n“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter,” the statement read.\\n\\nTesla said it delivered 1.25 million of its less-expensive Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, and nearly 67,000 of its higher-end Model X and Model X lines.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 12, 7, 0): ['By\\n\\nGigafactory Berlin has developed a bit of a reputation among Tesla’s vehicle production facilities. While it is capable of producing Model Y units with excellent quality, and while it is home to the company’s most advanced paint shop, Giga Berlin is also the facility that constantly attracted opposition during its buildout process.\\n\\nTesla faced numerous challenges while establishing operations at Giga Berlin. Environmentalists closely monitored Tesla’s activities and local residents expressed concerns about potential water depletion in the area. Giga Berlin critics have put in some serious effort to block the facility from operating. And when these initiatives were unsuccessful, efforts were still launched against the facility.\\n\\nWhile Giga Berlin has not yet reached its target capacity of 500,000 Model Y per year, Tesla is already looking ahead to the facility’s next phase. Phase 2 of Giga Berlin is expected to expand the plant’s production capacity by an additional 500,000 units, which should give the factory an output of one million vehicles per year.\\n\\nThe \"Amtsblatt\" contains a lot of information.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. §8a BImSchG will be used again.\\n\\n2.

An rbb24 report indicated that the company is in the public consultation stage for Phase 2. This provides individuals the opportunity to review the plans’ available documentation online from July 19 to August 18. The public will then have the opportunity to voice their concerns and opposition during a public hearing, tentatively scheduled for October.\\n\\nAs indicated in the plans submitted to the Brandenburg Environment Ministry, Tesla intends to construct a new large production hall for its expanded vehicle production area. The company is also looking to optimize operations on its existing line to enhance productivity. Apart from this, Tesla is planning to double the capacity of its battery production facility from 50 GWh to 100 GWh per year.\\n\\nIt is almost certain that Tesla’s plans to expand Giga Berlin will be met with opposition from the facility’s longtime critics. That being said, the electric vehicle maker could make a pretty compelling case. After all, Tesla believes it can double Giga Berlin’s capacity to 1 million vehicles per year without increasing its water usage at all. That’s a very difficult point to oppose, since the facility already consumes the same amount of water today.\\n\\nTesla plans to introduce hybrid cooling towers and eliminate quench tanks in the casting process. Cascade rinsing systems will also be implemented in the paint shop and battery can wash process. Serious efforts will be made to treat and recycle water as well. Rainwater is also set to be captured, recycled, and utilized for cooling manufacturing equipment. Even the condensed water from the plant’s air conditioning system is expected to be used in the cooling towers to offset water consumption.\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

But while the ramp of the vehicle’s production was quick, the facility ended up facing multiple challenges over the years. Last year, for example, Giga Shanghai’s production was halted due to Covid restrictions in China. Supply chain issues also caused headwinds to the facility’s operations.\\n\\nGigafactory Shanghai currently serves as Tesla’s primary vehicle export hub, with the facility catering to multiple markets across several continents. These include the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Asian countries like Thailand. Earlier this year, the facility also started providing Model Y units to Canada.\\n\\nWhile Tesla has already built several other vehicle factories since Giga Shanghai, the China-based facility is still a hallmark of efficiency and productivity. Today, the factory is the company’s largest facility by output. The fact that it only produces two cars — the Model 3 and Model Y — makes this accomplishment even more impressive.\\n\\nElon Musk has given Giga Shanghai due praise over the years. In a recent visit to the facility, the CEO praised the factory’s staff for producing cars that are of the highest quality.\\n\\n\\ufeff”It’s been incredibly impressive how you’ve been able to overcome so many difficulties and many challenges.

She predicted earlier this year that the electric vehicle (EV) stock could hit $2,000 per share by 2027. That's roughly 6.4 times Tesla's current price.\\n\\nIt might be surprising, therefore, that Wood isn't buying more Tesla shares. Instead, her Ark Invest exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sold off around $21 million of the stock only hours before Tesla reported its second-quarter earnings and the subsequent dip in its share price.\\n\\nNow, though, Wood is scooping up shares of another magnificent growth stock. Let's see why.\\n\\nTrading out Tesla\\n\\nTesla announced its Q2 results after the market close on Wednesday, July 19. In the two days before the earnings update, a couple of Wood's ARK ETFs reduced their stakes in the EV maker.\\n\\nHer flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK) sold 38,329 Tesla shares on Monday and 24,189 shares on Tuesday. These transactions were worth close to $18 million. Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKW) also sold 6,855 Tesla shares on Monday and 4,470 shares on Tuesday. The two sales generated around $3 million. In total, Wood's ETFs sold around $21 million of Tesla stock in the 72-hour period before the company's Q2 update.\\n\\nBut Wood found another stock to pour money into now. On the same days her ETFs were selling Tesla, they were buying shares of Twilio (TWLO -0.90%). ARKK scooped up more than $18 million of the technology company, while ARKW bought around $3 million worth of Twilio shares. In addition, the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF purchased roughly $2 million of the stock.\\n\\nWhat's behind the latest moves?\\n\\nWood has by no means given up on Tesla. Even with the recent sales, the EV stock remains the top holding for ARKK and Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF, as well as the fifth-largest position for ARKW.\\n\\nAlthough she didn't reveal the reason behind the Tesla sales, it's likely that Wood simply needed to rebalance the portfolios in her ETFs somewhat. Tesla's huge year-to-date gain probably made its weight in the ETFs a little higher than Wood preferred.\\n\\nWe can make a pretty good guess why Wood invested a significant chunk of money in Twilio, too. Activist investor Legion Partners is pushing Twilio to make changes that benefit shareholders. The company has already restructured to boost its bottom line.\\n\\nEven though Twilio's shares have jumped more than 30% so far this year, the stock is still 85% below its peak in early 2021. Wood seems to believe that Twilio will get its groove back. She's not alone in that view. Of the 13 analysts surveyed in July by Refinitiv, 10 rate Twilio as either a buy or a strong buy.\\n\\nMore magnificent than Tesla?\\n\\nWood wouldn't be investing so heavily in Twilio if she didn't think it was a magnificent growth stock. But does she believe it's more magnificent than Tesla? I doubt it.\\n\\nSure, Tesla commands a significantly higher valuation than Twilio. However, my view is that Wood sees this premium as appropriate. After all, if Tesla grows as much as she thinks it will, the current share price will look cheap in retrospect.\\n\\nStill, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Ark Invest ETFs buy even more shares of Twilio in the coming weeks and months. Wood's favorite might be Tesla, but it doesn't mean she can't really like other stocks too.\",\n  \"With a market cap of $913 billion as of July 19, Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) has clearly become one of the largest and most followed businesses in the world. And this has all happened in a relatively short time, after the company was founded just 20 years ago.\\n\\nThanks to this meteoric rise, Tesla has made some investors lots of money. Those who were smart enough to put $1,000 into this top electric vehicle (EV) stock as recently as just five years ago would have $13,500, translating to a monster gain of 1,250%. The Nasdaq Composite Index, by comparison, climbed just 83% during the same time.\\n\\nWhile it's unrealistic to assume that Tesla can come even remotely close to repeating this performance in the next five years, that doesn't necessarily mean it will be a bad investment. Let's run through what makes this a compelling company to own, as well as why investors might still be hesitant.\\n\\nTesla is a dominant force in the industry\\n\\nTesla has been a true trailblazer for the EV industry. The company now commands a dominant share of the domestic market for new EV sales, thanks mainly to its first-mover advantage. Tesla shipped 466,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2023, up 83% year over year. No other car manufacturer comes close to this level of EV scale.\\n\\nOver the years, Tesla has developed an economic moat, or traits that allow it to fend off rivals. It's a powerful brand, now known for luxury and tech-enabled automobiles. CEO Elon Musk also has a lot to do with keeping the brand on top of consumers' minds. It also helps that the company sells premium vehicles, giving it better margins than most in the industry.\\n\\nThe most obvious growth opportunity lies in producing and delivering more vehicles. And the company can introduce new models. The business started production on its highly anticipated Cybertruck, which can give Tesla a formidable competitor in the market for pickup trucks, the most popular type of vehicle sold in the U.S.\\n\\nAnd you can't ignore Musk's ambitions when it comes to the energy industry. Tesla is a car company, yes, but in the future, it could generate the bulk of its revenue from renewable energy initiatives. And this can certainly supercharge growth.\\n\\nInvestors might hesitate to buy the stock\\n\\nConsidering that Tesla shares have skyrocketed in recent years, coupled with the fact that this is already one of the most valuable businesses in the world, it's perhaps not surprising that the stock appears to be overvalued today. Shares currently trade at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 77. While this is far lower than its historical average P/E of 413, it still makes Tesla an expensive stock.\\n\\nIt's probably not an apt comparison to look at Ford's P/E of 20 and General Motors' P/E of 6, just because these businesses seriously lag Tesla's growth and profit potential. Nonetheless, it gives you an idea of the optimism priced into the shares.\\n\\nAnd Tesla is more expensive than a company like Ferrari that straddles the automotive industry and the market for luxury goods. Right now, Ferrari's stock sells at a P/E multiple of 57. So it might be safe to assume that Tesla shares are a bit expensive.\\n\\nBesides the valuation, investors could shy away because of how competitive the EV industry is becoming. While late to the game, the aforementioned Ford and GM are investing heavily in their own EV capabilities, as many other companies are. This means that Tesla's tremendous growth will likely slow down in the years ahead, as it won't be the only game in town.\\n\\nTesla has cut the prices on its vehicles numerous times, a clear indicator of how the market works. The business wants to push more volume, which will pressure margins, as we saw in the latest quarter. Customers certainly consider the brand when making a purchasing decision, but price might be the most important factor. That's always how it will be, a reality Tesla will have to deal with.\\n\\nIf investors are OK with these risks, then maybe the stock looks like a buy right now. Just don't expect the next five years' returns to resemble the past.\",\n  'Tesla chargers near Gatwick were not connected as the grid cannot cope with demand\\n\\nTo install a bank of 16 Tesla superchargers in readiness for this weekend’s holiday getaway cost £1 million.\\n\\nBut motorists hoping to plug in their electric cars drove off in frustration when they found the chargers had not been connected to the mains power supply, because the grid was not ready to cope with the demand.\\n\\nSponsored\\n\\nAccording to Ken McMeikan, chief executive of Moto, which operates the Pease Pottage site near Gatwick, the power was supposed to be switched on at the start of the month, but will now be delayed until September 9, missing the entire summer holidays.\\n\\nWith charging stations in high demand for the 400,000 electric car (EV) drivers expected to be travelling on Britain’s roads this weekend, McMeikan, who runs the'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 9, 7, 0): ['Tesla officially broke ground Monday on a Texas lithium refinery, making it the only U.S. automaker to refine its own lithium.\\n\\nCEO Elon Musk said the refinery will produce enough battery-grade lithium for 1 million electric vehicles by 2025, which would make Tesla the largest processor of lithium in North America. Tesla will continue to rely on existing suppliers like Albemarle and Livent as it aims to reach its 2023 sales goal of around 1.8 million cars globally.\\n\\nLithium is the key critical material in lithium-ion batteries that power the electric vehicle revolution. Today, the U.S. produces just 1% of the world’s lithium, with Australia, Chile and China leading the way. The Biden administration’s EV tax credit aims to spur more domestic battery material sourcing and production and reduce the U.S.’s reliance on China, which hosts 60% of the world’s lithium refining capacity and nearly 80% of the world’s lithium-ion battery production capacity.\\n\\n“As we look ahead a few years, a fundamental choke point in the advancement of electric vehicles is the availability of battery-grade lithium,” said Musk, during the ground-breaking ceremony outside of Corpus Christi.\\n\\nThe CEO drove up to the event in a Cybertruck complete with a roof rack accessory that caught the attention of industry watchers. Government officials such as Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Nueces County Judge Connie Scott and Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Dept. of Energy Kathleen Hogan attended the event.\\n\\nMusk said the company aims to finish construction on the refinery next year, with full-scale production slated for 2025. The executive described the timeline as “extremely fast by normal standards.” That may be true, but it’s slower than Tesla had originally projected. During Tesla’s Investor Day in March, Drew Baglino, senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, said the company aimed to have the refinery operational by the end of this year and start production early next year.\\n\\nBaglino also said at the time that the refinery would have a 50 gigawatt-hour per year capacity, something Musk did not confirm during Monday’s event.\\n\\nDuring Investor Day, Musk also encouraged other startups to get involved in refining lithium, which he likened to “minting money.”\\n\\n“We’re doing it because we have to, not because we want to,” Musk said previously.\\n\\nTesla will invest $375 million to build the facility, according to filings with the Texas Comptroller. The refinery is Tesla’s latest expansion into Texas, which began when the company moved its headquarters to the state from California in 2021. The automaker invested nearly $6 billion into its Austin gigafactory last year. In January, Tesla said it planned to invest another $770 million to expand the factory to include cathode and drive unit manufacturing and a battery cell testing site.',\n  'By\\n\\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has noted in the past that he believes the Model Y has the potential to become the world’s best-selling car. The Model Y did not achieve this feat last year, but it definitely came close, according to recent data shared by JATO Dynamics.\\n\\nPer JATO Dynamics’ data, the Tesla Model Y sold about 747,000 units in 2022, a 91% increase compared to 2021. About 44% of the Model Y’s sales occurred in China, 34% in the United States, and 19% in Europe. With these results, the Model Y became the world’s third-best-selling car last year.\\n\\nThe Model Y’s performance in 2022 is very impressive, especially considering that the only two vehicles that overtook it were the Toyota RAV4, which had just over a million units sold, and the Toyota Corolla sedan, which saw 992,000 units sold. Both the Toyota RAV4 and the Corolla are more affordable vehicles compared to the Tesla Model Y.\\n\\nWhat’s quite interesting is that the Model Y is not the only Tesla whose global sales performed well last year. As per JATO, the Model 3 sedan also became the world’s 10th best-selling car in 2022 with around 482,000 units sold. That’s quite an incredible accomplishment for the Model 3, Tesla’s most affordable car to date, considering that the vehicle competes in the sedan market.\\n\\nFelipe Munoz, JATO’s Global Analyst, shared his thoughts about the Model Y and Model 3’s feat last year. “It is a historic moment to see a pure electric vehicle not only so close to the top position but also a relatively new brand getting so far in the global ranking, particularly given they are not the most affordable vehicles,” Munoz said.\\n\\nThe Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

Tesla, for example, already uses transformers popularized by large language models for lane and intersection prediction.[5] In our view, Tesla’s vertical integration strategy and Dojo training supercomputer are key competitive advantages. Training currently runs at 100% capacity, suggesting that Tesla’s plan to expand Dojo by two orders of magnitude next year will help the company shorten the time between model updates.[6] Recent videos of its latest full self-driving (FSD) software update, including one of a driver who nearly completes a full ride-hail ride without touching the wheel, suggest that Tesla is close to launch in some geographies.[7] Tesla’s data library should help prove statistically the safety of its vehicles, giving it significant advantage over peers in the regulatory approval process. Tesla’s customer-owned fleet drives more than 120 million miles per day, and over one million miles per day in FSD.[8] In contrast, in their multi-year lifetimes, Cruise and Waymo have reached just one million miles each driven on public roads with no one behind the wheel. Moreover, accident statistics suggest that Tesla already has achieved performance superior to human drivers. According to our research, adjusting for its use on surface streets only, Tesla’s FSD is 5X safer than a manually driven Tesla.\\n\\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2023. Based on data from Tesla, Inc. 2023a; Tesla, Inc. 2023b; Tesla, Inc. 2023c; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2023; Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2023. Note: Both the Non-Autopilot accident rate, labeled “Manually Driven Tesla” in the graph, and the national average were adjusted to surface-street only accident rates using the ratio of percent of accidents to miles driven on surface streets, including an adjustment for auto-pilot miles, which ARK estimates were ~10% of miles driven in Teslas. Note that this a global statistic and the US average is likely higher. Chart FSD data as of March 1, 2023. Five important caveats to consider: (1) a driver might disengage FSD in the most difficult driving moments, which could boost miles per accident; (2) FSD will not work in extreme weather; (3) while passenger cars make up the majority of vehicles in crashes and total miles, the national statistics are not confined to passenger cars; (4) our comparison includes all crashes, fatal and non-fatal; (5) The national average includes vehicles that do not have active safety features such as auto emergency braking, which are now standard on all new cars, including Teslas.

Capital expenditure per incremental unit of capacity improved from ~$84,000 when the Model 3 was ramping in 2017 to ~$7,700, in 2021. Simultaneous production ramps at two Gigafactories led capital efficiency measured at the end of the year to increase to $14,755 in 2022. Once the initial ramp of those factories is complete, the implied capital expenditure per unit capacity continues its decline to ~$7,000 as shown below.[9]\\n\\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2023. Note: In 2022, Tesla’s capital expenditure per unit of production capacity was $14,755, up from $7,683 in 2021. ARK believes that this is not an accurate measurement as capital investment was incurred with respect to Berlin and Austin Gigafactory in 2022, however, these factories had not yet hit volume production by year-end. As such, ARK believes that a more accurate measurement of Capital Efficiency is to adjust the 2022 vehicles produced to incorporate the initial production volume of these factories to get the true capital cost per vehicle. This re-calculated amount results in a capital efficiency rate of $7,288.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any particular security.\\n\\nWhile these improvements indicate that Tesla could continue to increase margins, the more important takeaway is that capital is not a bottleneck limiting growth. Instead, Tesla should be able to grow as quickly as management bandwidth and supply constraints allow—two factors we model by constraining Tesla’s annual production growth using the “Max Annual Production Increase” input. Tesla’s Investor Day on March 1, 2023, highlighted its next generation vehicle architecture and manufacturing process, including steps to reduce the footprint and time associated with building factories, which should reduce bandwidth requirements and accelerate scaling. Stationary Energy Storage Deployment\\n\\nWe expect Tesla to prioritize its vehicle business. To reflect this in this year’s model, we scale its stationary energy storage business only as the vehicle business becomes scaling constrained. According to our analysis, energy storage should contribute $6.6 billion, or 3%, to Tesla’s expected enterprise value in 2027. In ARK’s expected value, ~16% of all battery capacity goes into stationary energy storage and ~84% goes toward vehicles, resulting in ~200 GWh of stationary energy storage deployed in 2027, as shown in the second chart below.[10]\\n\\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2023.

A robotaxi should provide the highest investment return on batteries for Tesla, as shown below. With a robotaxi platform, Tesla should be able to generate earnings from both the vehicle sale and a recurring ride-hail revenue stream, which ARK believes could generate software-like margins. As Elon Musk has phrased it, autonomous ride-hail “probably will be the biggest asset value increase in history.”[11]\\n\\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2023.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any particular security.\\n\\nAccording to our analysis, the stationary energy business should yield margins of ~20-25%. We have not modeled the option value embedded in Tesla’s ability to turn its battery systems into virtual power plants that allocate dynamically to overtaxed electrical grids, or returns from participating in capacity markets. Tesla also could accelerate its energy storage strategy by vertically integrating cryptocurrency mining and home HVAC systems. For now, we consider such options beyond the scope of this model. Share Price Forecast\\n\\nOur simulation is highly sensitive to the year in which Tesla launches robotaxis, as shown in the two charts below. The chart titled “Modeled Share Price Outcomes” represents the likely distribution of all possible price targets from our Monte Carlo analysis and identifies the bear and bull cases as the 25th and 75th percentile outcomes, respectively. “Expected value” is the average of all 1 million simulations. The chart titled “Modeled Scenarios” illustrates the mix of robotaxi and human ride-hail outcomes that corresponds with each share price represented in the prior “Modeled Share Price Outcomes” chart. In our lowest price-per-share scenarios, Tesla launches a vertically-integrated, human-driven ride-hail service but does not launch a robotaxi network—as shown in dark grey on the lower left-hand corner) Although Tesla has not committed publicly to launching human-driven ride-hail, ARK previously detailed the strategic and tactical advantages of doing so. Note that in many of our higher price-per-share scenarios, Tesla launches a robotaxi network within the next two years.\\n\\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2023.

Bitcoin Assumptions\\n\\nWe updated our bitcoin assumptions in line with ARK’s current bitcoin expectations.[12] The digital asset continues to have less than a 5% impact on our 2027 expected price per share. Equity Raise\\n\\nAs in last year’s model, we assume Tesla will use ~$3 billion in additional equity for incentive compensation. Given the cash we expect from the autonomous ride-hail network and electric vehicle sales, we do not anticipate that Tesla will need to raise more capital. Balance Sheet\\n\\nWe have made conservative assumptions about strategic financial decisions. We do not believe these decisions will be primary drivers of Tesla’s stock price appreciation: Tesla holds cash and bitcoin on its balance sheet and does not benefit from any yield-generating assets.\\n\\nWith more cash than debt on its balance sheet, Tesla does not use the cash to pay down debt. The interest cost of the debt remains at 4%.\\n\\nTesla does not repurchase shares. Note: The assumptions above could lead to divergences between our forecast of Tesla’s share price and the actual price of Tesla shares. Our modeling cannot include all variables that will impact Tesla’s share price and our assumptions could be inaccurate and incomplete. Moreover, our assumptions are subject to change as more information becomes available. Our estimates and forecasts are subject to risks and limitations and should not be relied upon for individual investment decisions. Business Opportunities Not Included In The Model\\n\\nWe do not believe that either Dojo training-as-a-service or Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot will contribute significantly to Tesla’s value within our five-year investment time horizon, though they could drive value over a longer time horizon. Risks and Limits of Our Monte Carlo Model\\n\\nARK’s 41 independent variables are meant to cover all scenarios that we see as plausible outcomes for Tesla over the next five years. An unexpected event, such as Elon Musk’s sudden departure from the company, or a natural disaster or pandemic, could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. Conclusion\\n\\nGiven the updates outlined in this article, ARK’s price target for Tesla is $2,000 per share in 2027. Our bear and bull cases suggest that TSLA could be valued between ~$1,400 and $2,500 per share in 2027. We have published our simulation model on GitHub and invite readers to explore and test assumptions and/or craft visualizations in the simulations.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 6, 7, 0): ['Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) has gained a reputation for smashing records, shattering expectations, and making constant technological breakthroughs. The company is on the verge of cementing that reputation with its biggest accomplishment to date.\\n\\nOn Aug. 25, CEO Elon Musk posted a 45-minute video of himself in the driver\\'s seat of a moving Tesla Model 3, except he wasn\\'t driving. To showcase Tesla\\'s new version 12 (widely abbreviated as \"v12\") of its full self-driving (FSD) software, Musk showed off the vehicle parallel-parking, starting and stopping at traffic lights, and navigating roundabouts, all while his hands held his phone to record the video.\\n\\nTesla is one step closer to full autonomy in its vehicles\\n\\nAlthough v12 still has limitations and needs considerable refinement, the software represents a monumental leap in Tesla\\'s pursuit of obtaining Level 4 or Level 5 autonomy -- levels in which drivers no longer need to monitor the car while it\\'s underway.\\n\\nWhat distinguishes v12 from previous versions of FSD is its sole reliance on neural networks powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Past FSD software used neural networks to map vehicle surroundings, but the course of action the vehicle would take still required hard coding by Tesla programmers. With v12, humans are no longer needed to define specific responses.\\n\\nThanks to advances in AI development, v12 can interpret and discern the best response for a vehicle on its own. By analyzing a metric ton of video and driver behavior collected from its 4 million vehicles around the world, Tesla\\'s supercomputer Dojo and a host of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) were able to train neural networks to learn the proper decisions to make in any situation.\\n\\nWhy v12 is a big deal for Tesla\\n\\nDeveloping responses for self-driving cars was a difficult task for Tesla\\'s programmers. The unpredictable nature of driving meant they had to account for a wide range of variations, limiting the capabilities of previous versions of Tesla\\'s FSD.\\n\\nHowever, advances in v12 and self-training neural networks will make human programmers unnecessary, increasing autonomy and the speed at which the neural networks learn. Now, Tesla\\'s biggest challenge in achieving Levels 4 and 5 of autonomous driving will lie in its ability to collect and process video data. Fortunately, this task should be much easier than the initial challenge of developing and training neural networks, since Tesla already has a large fleet of vehicles collecting video and has its own computing infrastructure to handle the heavy lifting.\\n\\nTaking Tesla to new heights\\n\\nWhile Level 4 or 5 autonomy will make roads safer and is a noble pursuit in itself, development of more advanced FSD will help Tesla reach its ultimate goal of creating a robotaxi business. Developing such a service is currently Tesla\\'s No. 1 priority, mainly because Elon Musk said he believes that there is \"quasi-infinite demand\" for it, and because it could transform Tesla\\'s sources of income.\\n\\nAlthough Musk is known for exaggerating timelines and flaunting his confidence that Tesla shares could 10x from today\\'s prices, he isn\\'t alone in recognizing that a robotaxi fleet could revolutionize Tesla\\'s finances, and potentially catapult it to being one of the most valuable companies in the world.\\n\\nIn an attempt to quantify just how impactful a robotaxi business would be for Tesla, the investing firm Ark Invest (which has some of Tesla\\'s biggest fans) released a report in April 2023 highlighting findings from a Monte Carlo simulation.\\n\\nThe results were grouped into a bearish scenario, an average scenario, and a bullish scenario. Based on the outcomes, Ark Invest hypothesized that successful implementation of robotaxis could generate revenue anywhere from $200 billion in the bearish scenario to nearly $613 billion in the bullish scenario. Furthermore, it estimated that robotaxis could contribute more than two-thirds of the company\\'s future earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\\n\\nLike any simulation or model, Ark Invest\\'s analysis has its limitations. Still, even in its bear case, in which robotaxis produce just $200 billion in annual revenue, that would be a jump of 700% from Tesla\\'s current revenue of just under $25 billion.\\n\\nMoving forward\\n\\nAlthough simulations like the one Ark conducted remain speculative, they shed some light on just how transformative the achievement of autonomous driving and the development of a robotaxi business could be for Tesla. With its shares down more than 30% from their all-time high, now could be an opportunistic moment for investors.\\n\\nMacroeconomic factors such as inflation and rising interest rates have cut into Tesla\\'s profit margins and are the primary reason share prices took a hit. But the company is confident in its ability to weather short-term market fluctuations, thanks to its robust financial standing and continued record-breaking production and revenue. With the likelihood of a highly lucrative robotaxi business and FSD on the horizon, Tesla could lead AI, electric vehicles (EVs), and portfolios for years to come.',\n  'Which company first comes to mind when you think of electric-vehicle (EV) innovation? I suspect many, if not most, people would have the same answer: Tesla (TSLA -3.13%).\\n\\nElon Musk\\'s company didn\\'t invent the electric car, of course. However, Tesla was a pioneer in showing how EVs could be practical, fast, and stylish.\\n\\nToday, Tesla dominates the U.S. EV market. In the first half of 2023, the company sold close to 300,000 more electric cars than its nearest rival. But could Tesla be in trouble with a potentially game-changing EV development from another automaker?\\n\\nFinding \"the Holy Grail\"\\n\\nToyota (TM -2.04%) recently announced what could be \"the Holy Grail\" of electric vehicles. The Japanese automaker revealed plans to launch a new battery-powered car with a driving range of over 900 miles and a charging time of only 10 minutes.\\n\\nThe key to this game-changing development is Toyota\\'s solid-state battery technology. Solid-state batteries are similar to the lithium-ion batteries currently used in most EVs. Instead of using liquid electrolytes through which lithium ions flow, they use a solid electrolyte.\\n\\nHowever, solid-state batteries are better than lithium-ion batteries in several ways. They last longer, take less time to charge, and are smaller. They\\'re also less likely to catch on fire.\\n\\nThe main problem with solid-state batteries, though, has been they\\'re more expensive to make than lithium-ion ones. Toyota believes that it has achieved a breakthrough that will allow it to manufacture solid-state batteries at a much lower cost. The company stated that it expects to begin mass production of its solid-state battery as soon as 2027.\\n\\nLeaving Tesla behind?\\n\\nTesla\\'s Model S boasts a driving range of a little over 400 miles. Musk has claimed in the past that the company could extend the range to 600 miles. However, he said that Tesla didn\\'t want to make the trade-offs that would be required to do so, including lower acceleration and poorer handling.\\n\\nActually driving 400 miles in a Tesla Model S depends on several factors, though, notably including weather conditions. Cold weather can negatively impact the range of lithium-ion batteries. That\\'s not a problem for solid-state batteries.\\n\\nTesla\\'s Superchargers can charge up to 200 miles in 15 minutes. However, that\\'s still 50% more time required than the 10-minute charge Toyota is touting.\\n\\nToyota didn\\'t talk about the potential for its batteries to last much longer than lithium-ion batteries, which tend to begin degrading much sooner than solid-state batteries do. This could be yet another plus for Toyota.\\n\\nNot in trouble -- for now\\n\\nIs Tesla in trouble? Not at this point. And there\\'s no guarantee that solid-state batteries will be its Achilles\\' heel.\\n\\nFor one thing, Toyota has earned a reputation for overpromising and underdelivering when it comes to its EV technology. As recently as 2017, the company was trumpeting solid-state batteries that could be used in cars by 2020. That didn\\'t happen.\\n\\nBut Toyota isn\\'t alone in developing solid-state battery technology. Several other electric-vehicle battery makers are also moving forward aggressively with their own efforts.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Tesla is developing an alternative to solid-state batteries. The company\\'s lithium-ion 4680 batteries hold the potential to check off several of the same boxes that solid-state batteries do, including increasing the range by more than 50%. In Tesla\\'s latest quarterly update, management stated that the company has produced more than 10 million 4680 cells in its Texas facility.\\n\\nStill, there\\'s a real possibility that Tesla could regret not investing more heavily in its own solid-state battery technology. Driving range and charging times rank as two of the biggest complaints about electric vehicles today. If Toyota solves these issues more effectively than Tesla does, it just might be able to take away market share in the future.'],\n datetime.datetime(2022, 12, 21, 8, 0): [\"Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) became a publicly traded company in June 2010, and back then, electric vehicles were the whole of its business. Given the company has become the largest player in that industry globally, it's safe to say its journey so far has been a wild success.\\n\\nBut Tesla continues to expand into new areas with astronomical potential, which makes its stock tricky to value. Nonetheless, the company is worth substantially more today than it was at its initial public offering (IPO) -- even after accounting for the 62% drop in its share price this year.\\n\\nHere's how the company got there, and just how much early investors have been rewarded.\\n\\nThe journey to 2 million cars, residential solar power, and... robots?\\n\\nDespite a tough economy, 2022 has been a landmark year for Tesla. It opened new gigafactories in Texas and Berlin, it delivered its first semi-truck, and it even unveiled plans to sell a humanoid robot called Optimus by 2027.\\n\\nBack in 2012, Tesla generated $413 million in revenue, and it was producing electric vehicles at an annual rate of 20,000 units. Fast-forward 10 years, and it's on track to generate $83 billion in revenue this year with the capacity to produce cars at an annual rate of about 2 million units.\\n\\nBut the company's potential extends beyond its core business. Its autonomous self-driving technology could transform the mobility industry, which could be a $2.1 trillion opportunity by 2030. Tesla intends to release a robotaxi capable of full self-driving in 2024, which could disrupt both the ride-hailing and traditional taxi industries.\\n\\nSeparately, its residential solar and battery storage products are experiencing soaring demand, with production struggling to keep pace. Tesla deployed a record 2,100 megawatt-hours of storage during the third quarter (ended Sept. 30), which was more than the previous two quarters combined, even with continued supply chain disruptions.\\n\\nBut one of Tesla's most lucrative opportunities could arrive toward the end of this decade. Elon Musk believes the company will be selling millions of its Optimus robots that could reshape industries like manufacturing forever, allowing its business customers to run production around the clock. With an estimated price tag of $20,000, Optimus could be a multibillion-dollar windfall.\\n\\nTesla's internal and external challenges are mounting\\n\\nAs instrumental as he's been to Tesla's success, Musk has been somewhat of a wild card this year following his mammoth $44 billion acquisition of social media giant Twitter. It appears to have shifted his focus away from Tesla, which has many stakeholders concerned.\\n\\nInvestors tend to vote with their feet, and although the broader tech sector has been decimated this year, the 62% drop in Tesla stock vastly underperforms the Nasdaq-100 index, which is down just 31%.\\n\\nPlus, growing competition in the electric vehicle space, combined with declining consumer spending power amid the weak economic environment, appears to be creating a demand problem for Tesla. One estimate suggests the order backlog for its vehicles fell to 190,000 in November, which is down by more than half from its July peak of 476,000.\\n\\nThis is also a function of Tesla's record rate of production at the moment, which is clearing customer orders more quickly. For example, the company manufactured nearly 130,000 more cars in Q3 than it did at the same time last year.\\n\\nBut with economic headwinds like high inflation appearing to ease recently, there's a chance the consumer outlook could improve in the new year. In any case, Tesla's early investors are still sitting on mammoth gains.\\n\\nHere's how much a $10,000 investment in Tesla's IPO would be worth now\\n\\nTesla hit the public markets in June 2010, priced at $17 per share. That was firmly above its indicated range of $14 to $16, highlighting investors' enthusiasm for the company even in the early days.\\n\\nSince then, the value of Tesla has soared so high that management elected to split the stock twice, reducing the price per share to ensure it remained accessible to smaller investors. The first split was 5-for-1 in August 2020. The second split was 3-for-1 in August 2022.\\n\\nAccounting for both of those events, Tesla's $17 IPO price would be adjusted down to $1.13. At the stock's recent price of $150.23, IPO investors would be sitting on a gain of 13,255%.\\n\\nIn dollar terms, an investment of $10,000 would now be worth over $1.32 million.\\n\\nIt means your money would have grown at a compound annual rate of 48%, which is nearly five times higher than the return generated by the benchmark S&P 500 stock market index over the same period.\\n\\nIt's likely the stock will continue to outperform over the next decade (and beyond) given the sheer magnitude of Tesla's opportunities, so investors might want to buy now and take advantage of this year's 62% drop.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 12, 7, 0): ['With the Nasdaq Composite index up 32% in 2023 (as of Aug. 9), it\\'s clear that investors are starting to feel optimistic again. That\\'s especially true following the double-digit loss posted last year.\\n\\nBut some stocks, like Tesla (TSLA -3.13%), have trounced the overall market. Shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker are up a whopping 100% this year. And its market cap is close to $800 billion.\\n\\nWith the stock up so much in 2023, should investors buy, sell, or hold Tesla right now? Let\\'s take a closer look at this top automotive stock.\\n\\nA leader in the EV market\\n\\nTesla beat Wall Street estimates for the three-month period that ended June 30. Revenue totaled $24.9 billion, with diluted earnings per share coming in at $0.91 (on an adjusted basis). But shares have been under pressure, down 15% since that second-quarter earnings announcement.\\n\\nInvestors have been concerned this year about the management team\\'s ongoing pricing cuts, which have eaten away at margins. Tesla\\'s gross margin and operating margin last quarter of 18.2% and 9.6%, respectively, were down considerably from the year-ago period. However, it\\'s encouraging that the business still generates better profit metrics than legacy automakers like Ford Motor Company and General Motors.\\n\\n\"The short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture,\" founder and CEO Elon Musk said on the Q2 2023 earnings call. \"Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly.\" Shareholders can either believe what he says or take it with a grain of salt.\\n\\nBut despite the hit to margins, Tesla\\'s growth is still impressive. Automotive revenue, which excludes sales of energy storage products and other services, was up 46% year over year and up 533% versus just five years ago. The business produced 1.7 million cars in the last 12 months, a figure that Musk hopes to get to 20 million annually by 2030.\\n\\nAs the undisputed pioneer and leader of the EV market, the company has built up a phenomenal brand that resonates with consumers across the world. And the premium image of Tesla, bolstered by its popular cars with elegantly designed interiors and exteriors, is a key competitive advantage that can benefit it for a long time.\\n\\nInvestors have to think things through\\n\\nBuying or holding on to Tesla right now, even though its shares have soared, likely wouldn\\'t be too difficult of a decision to make. This is already one of the most valuable and beloved businesses in the world, with a founder and CEO who has a huge fan base. And it\\'s hard to bet against Musk in any capacity, especially as he continues to move the world forward in impactful ways.\\n\\nInvestors who have long been shareholders might believe that Tesla still has a long runway for growth in front of it, thus maintaining a portfolio position. Perhaps fully self-driving vehicle capabilities will get here sooner rather than later. And this completely changes the financial profile of the business, resulting in outsize scale and profits. Moreover, stockholders could be bullish on Tesla\\'s energy ambitions as well, which also present huge end markets.\\n\\nHowever, after the stock\\'s monumental rise in 2023, plus its 2,270% gain over the past decade, I can see why investors might also be inclined to sell their Tesla holdings and book a profit if they\\'ve been sitting on unrealized gains. Although the company looks to be on a path of consistent profitability going forward, the stock isn\\'t cheap, trading at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 70, much higher than the P/E of 30 to start the year. Sellers could redirect that capital to other attractive opportunities.\\n\\nInvestors have to decide for themselves, based on their own circumstances and outlook, what to do with Tesla shares right now.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 27, 7, 0): ['Few, if any, stocks have captivated Wall Street\\'s and investors\\' attention quite like electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla (TSLA -3.13%). While EVs have been widely discussed as the next evolution of the consumer auto market to reduce carbon emissions, it\\'s Tesla that\\'s (pardon the pun) led the charge.\\n\\nAmong current S&P 500 components, Tesla is tough to top. Over the trailing-10-year period (as of April 24, 2023), Tesla stock has gained 4,680%, which outpaces the total return of the benchmark S&P 500, including dividends paid, by more than 4,450%!\\n\\nIn some ways, this outperformance is warranted.

I\\'m going to share four reasons why.\\n\\n1. Ark Invest\\'s implied production ramp for Tesla isn\\'t achievable\\n\\nOne of the first figures that makes little sense in Ark Invest\\'s Tesla forecast is the total number of vehicles produced.\\n\\nTesla produced 1.37 million EVs in 2022. Cathie Wood and her team are now modeling between 10.3 million cars sold in the bear case and 20.7 million sold in the bull outcome for 2027. Based on Tesla\\'s own guidance of 1.8 million EVs produced for 2023, this works out to a 55% (bear case) to 84% (bull case) compound annual production growth rate over the subsequent four years.\\n\\nWith a full ramp up of Tesla\\'s four existing gigafactories, the company is pacing in the neighborhood of 2 million annual EVs in capacity. If Ark Invest\\'s Monte Carlo analysis is correct, the company would likely have to open and successfully ramp up more than a dozen new gigafactories over the next four years. That\\'s roughly one new gigafactory each quarter for the next four years.\\n\\nIt\\'s unlikely Tesla has the financial capacity to open this many new production facilities without borrowing a lot of money. More importantly, Tesla doesn\\'t have the best track record when it comes to opening new gigafactories on schedule or quickly ramping them up for optimal production.\\n\\n2. Vehicle margins are already under pressure\\n\\nAnother unrealistic figure proposed by Cathie Wood and her team is the EV gross margin, excluding regulatory emission credits, expected by 2027. In Ark\\'s bull model, the average selling price (ASP) for Tesla EVs is $26,000, leading to an ex-credits EV gross margin of 23%. In the bear model, the ASP is $34,000, leading to an ex-credits EV gross margin of 34%.\\n\\nThe simple problem is this: Tesla\\'s ex-credits automotive gross margin dropped to 18.3% during the first quarter of 2023, with an ASP that\\'s substantially higher than what Ark is modeling four years from now.\\n\\nWhile some folks have pointed to Tesla\\'s multiple rounds of price cuts in the U.S., China, and Europe as a sign of improved production efficiency, the company\\'s growing inventory levels suggest otherwise. When March came to a close, Tesla had 15 days\\' worth of global vehicle inventory, which is a 400% year-over-year increase and its highest mark since the third quarter of 2020. Rapidly rising inventory suggests more price cuts will be needed, which are expected to adversely impact EV gross margin.\\n\\nTesla may have ridden its first-mover advantages to a lofty valuation, but its recent price cuts are demonstrating that competition is indeed having a negative impact on this EV juggernaut.\\n\\n3. FSD has been a \"failure to deliver\" for Elon Musk and Tesla\\n\\nArk Invest\\'s baseline ($2,000) and bull ($2,500) outlooks for Tesla are also heavily dependent on the success of robotaxis -- i.e., a self-driving/driverless taxi. In the bull outcome that sees Tesla stock reach $2,500 in four years, Wood\\'s company has modeled in (I hope you\\'re sitting down for this) $613 billion in autonomous ride-hailing revenue for 2027.\\n\\nBut there\\'s one big snafu: Tesla hasn\\'t solved full self-driving (FSD), which is going to be a necessity for a robotaxi service.\\n\\nFor nine years, CEO Elon Musk has been promising that level 5 autonomy was just a year away. In fact, Musk claimed that his company might achieve full autonomy \"this year\" during Tesla\\'s first-quarter conference call a little over one week ago.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Tesla\\'s EVs haven\\'t moved beyond their level 2 autonomous designation, which allows for partial driving automation. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz has surpassed Tesla and achieved level 3 autonomy, albeit at speeds under 40 mph on Nevada roads. Translation: Tesla is nowhere close to achieving full self-driving, which means robotaxis aren\\'t a moneymaking option anytime soon.\\n\\n4. Ark\\'s robotaxi valuations are otherworldly\\n\\nTo build on the above point, Cathie Wood and her team have placed a significant emphasis on robotaxis in Tesla\\'s valuation for their Monte Carlo analysis. Robotaxis are expected to account for 44% of Tesla\\'s $1.02 trillion in sales by 2027, 64% of the company\\'s expected $354 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and a whopping 67% of its proposed $6.1 trillion enterprise value.\\n\\nFor a moment, let\\'s put aside the fact that Tesla hasn\\'t been able to move beyond level 2 autonomy and focus solely on Ark\\'s astronomical revenue and valuation forecasts for this operating segment.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, estimates for the size of the global ride-hailing and taxi business vary quite a bit. According to Straits Research, it generated $196.1 billion in global sales in 2021. For ResearchAndMarkets.com, it was an estimated $209.3 billion in 2021. No matter what report or estimate you believe is the most accurate, none remotely comes close to the roughly $450 billion in sales Wood\\'s investment firm is modeling at the baseline for Tesla\\'s robotaxi business by 2027.\\n\\nIn other words, Wood and her team have offered a truly otherworldly sales expectation and valuation -- an approximate $4 trillion enterprise value in 2027 -- for a business segment that doesn\\'t currently exist for Tesla.\\n\\nTesla is just a car company\\n\\nDespite Tesla\\'s best efforts to become more than just a car company, it\\'s (thus far) failed to do so. The company\\'s energy storage and supercharger segments generate low margins, while solar panel installation has been a money loser since day one. The only aspect of Tesla\\'s business that generates a profit and should hold any consideration for its valuation is its ability to sell and lease EVs.\\n\\nThe problem for Tesla is that traditional auto stocks usually trade between six and eight times their earnings per share. Even taking into account Tesla\\'s premium growth rate and net cash position, it doesn\\'t support the company trading at nearly 50 times Wall Street\\'s consensus earnings for 2023.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, Tesla\\'s free cash flow almost completely dried up during its price-cutting campaign in the first quarter. Wall Street had expected around $3.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF). Tesla delivered $441 million in FCF, and that was with the help of $521 million in regulatory emission credits, which flow straight to FCF. If we\\'re looking solely at Tesla\\'s operating performance, sans credits, it produced an $80 million free-cash outflow in the first quarter.\\n\\nThere\\'s simply no way to bridge the gap between Tesla\\'s existing struggles and Cathie Wood\\'s utopian forecast looking four years into the future. Ark Invest\\'s price target is utter nonsense.',\n  'As was widely feared, recent price cuts for Tesla\\'s (TSLA -3.13%) electric vehicles (EVs) took a toll on the company\\'s bottom line. The EV maker\\'s per-share earnings tumbled from $1.07 a year ago to $0.85 per share last quarter, while operating margins slipped from just over 19% to just above 11%. Critics of the lowered prices are vindicated.\\n\\nThere\\'s a method to the madness though, at least according to CEO Elon Musk. His conference call comment, \"It\\'s better to shift a large number of cars at lower margin and harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy,\" points to the electric car manufacturer\\'s intended future. And the strategy makes a superficial amount of sense.\\n\\nThere are key questions that remain unanswered, however, making it tough to step into a Tesla position or stick with the stock if you already own it.\\n\\nAll part of a bigger plan?\\n\\nTesla is still making plenty of money on each vehicle it sells, for the record. It\\'s just making less than it could be, thanks to lowered vehicle prices.\\n\\nThe specifics: All told, last quarter\\'s average per-car sales price of just over $47,000 is measurably lower than the fourth quarter\\'s average per-car revenue of more than $52,000. End result? Although up year over year, Tesla\\'s total first-quarter automotive revenue fell nearly 8% from Q4 2022\\'s top line despite a respectable 4.3% improvement on the fourth quarter\\'s total deliveries of over 405,000 vehicles.\\n\\nIt\\'s not quite as disastrous as it sounds. The average cost of production per car fell from Q4\\'s figure, too, from nearly $39,000 to just above $37,000 for Q1. The slide extends a long -- even if erratic -- downtrend of Tesla\\'s typical cost to build a single car. Those costs should continue to come down as Tesla adds scale; the company still intends to be building 20 million cars per year come 2030.\\n\\nNevertheless, these new numbers are far from being compelling. Gross profits per EV had been holding relatively steady at around $15,000 per car until last quarter when they fell to less than $10,000. Per-vehicle earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and net profit slumped as well. If this is the new norm, it\\'s not exactly a norm that thrills.\\n\\nAs is so often the case, however, Elon Musk has a bigger-picture plan, even if he\\'s not offering a great number of details about it just yet. That plan is the monetization of Tesla\\'s autonomous driving tech. Musk explains in Wednesday\\'s call, \"... we expect our vehicles over time will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy. So we do believe we\\'re ... laying the groundwork here and that it\\'s better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin and subsequently harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.\" Tesla\\'s chief went on to point out during the earnings call, \"... we\\'re the only ones making cars that technically we could sell for zero profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy.\"\\n\\nFair enough. While autonomous driving tech isn\\'t yet perfected, that day is coming sooner or later. And there\\'s no denying it\\'s got potential as a profit center in and of itself.\\n\\nIt\\'s just still not clear how.\\n\\nIt\\'s also not clear how the company\\'s current autonomous driving tech-development efforts will benefit from selling more-but-cheaper EVs to consumers now. And, when asked that very question during Wednesday\\'s call, Musk\\'s answer was more of a non-answer.\\n\\nTesla is switching gears, but...\\n\\nDeutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner pressed the issue, asking Elon Musk on Wednesday, \"Can you be a little bit more specific around ways you would be able to monetize sort of like this existing fleet in the future? ... My understanding was that robotaxi would probably be for the next-generation vehicle -- not the existing ones. So, I guess in which ways would you monetize it?\"\\n\\nMusk\\'s answer:\\n\\n\"Sorry. The robotaxi terminology can be a bit confusing because that\\'s sort of like a generic term for our next-generation vehicle. And we obviously are working on a next-generation vehicle. That\\'s going to be very compelling. This is just not the time to talk about it in details. ... So, we internally call it robotaxi. But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware 3 -- which is the vast majority of our fleet -- we believe will achieve full autonomy. ... a Model 3 or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi. So ... to the best of my knowledge, that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.\"\\n\\nWhat? It\\'s not only not much of an answer to Rosner\\'s question, it raises even more questions. Among these questions are when (or even if) a fleet of robotaxis might be put on roads en masse, why selling its electric vehicles at slimmer margins now helps the development of self-driving tech in the future, what might the robotaxi business model look like, and when will margins start improving?\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub. Investors are being asked to have faith in the next chapter of Tesla\\'s existence without being given any meaningful details about it. They\\'re also being asked to deal with slimmer margins in the meantime and to do so without any hints as to how long these weaker profits may persist. That\\'s a tall order, to be sure.\\n\\nToo many questions, and not enough answers to own Tesla stock\\n\\nNone of this means Tesla is doomed. Indeed, betting against Musk has historically been a bad bet. Not only is Tesla the market share leader for electric vehicles, but Musk can also be largely credited with bringing electric vehicles into the mainstream. Long-term investors have been well rewarded for their patience, too.\\n\\nThere\\'s also no denying the robotaxi industry -- whatever it ends up looking like and wherever Tesla finds itself within it -- is worth penetrating. Spherical Insights predicts the worldwide robotaxi market will grow at an annual pace of 80% through 2030 when it will be worth more than $100 billion per year. That outlook jibes with forecasts from Data Bridge Market Research, Mordor Intelligence, and others.\\n\\nSheer uncertainty firmly works against a stock\\'s value, though, and there\\'s plenty of it currently surrounding Tesla. Kudos to the company for being able to lower its per-car production costs. It\\'s just too bad that cost-cutting progress is being overshadowed by so many unknowns.\\n\\nIf you already own it, think (very) carefully about continuing to hold it. If you\\'re still only mulling a position in Tesla, though, you may want to consider other stocks until Musk can better articulate why its narrowed profit margins are necessary and until he can provide specifics about how its autonomous driving tech can be dependably monetized. He seems to be making an awfully big, expensive bet on this future, but this isn\\'t what most shareholders signed up for.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 15, 7, 0): [\"One of Tesla's (TSLA -3.13%) longest-standing and most consistent bulls is Ron Baron, a billionaire investor and chairman and CEO of Baron Capital. Even as Tesla aggressively cut prices this year and saw its profit margin narrow substantially, the famed investor's bullish sentiment was unfazed. He expects shares to rise to a price that's multiples higher than it's trading at today, he revealed during a CNBC interview this week.\\n\\nIs the investor onto something, or is his rosy view of the electric-car maker clouding his judgment and causing him to miss some red flags?\\n\\nThe bull case\\n\\nHighlighting his big bet on the company, Baron personally owns 4.5 million shares (valued at about $1.2 billion). Including his funds' holdings, his stake in the company stands at nearly $5 billion. It's no wonder he's so heavily invested; he believes Tesla shares could soar 4x to 5x from their current value over the next seven years, he told CNBC on Wednesday.\\n\\nSupporting his bull case, Ron pointed to its founder as a key reason for his continued belief in the company. Though he admitted Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk's unconventional ways often make Ron nervous, it takes an unconventional person to achieve extraordinary things.\\n\\nSome other key reasons for Ron's optimistic view of Tesla include Musk's relentless focus on driving down costs, the company's rapid growth in deliveries, the technology and software Tesla plans to license to competitors, and its fast-growing battery business. In the long term, he believes Tesla will produce 20 million cars per year (up from less than 2 million per year today) and expects its battery business to grow to 30x its current size.\\n\\nThe bear case\\n\\nThere are some notable risks for the stock. Although Tesla is growing incredibly fast, with deliveries rising 83% year over year in Q2 and management guiding to produce about 1.8 million vehicles this year (up from about 1.4 million last year), the company's aggressive price cuts this year suggest demand could be suffering as higher interest rates make vehicle affordability more difficult.\\n\\nFurther, some investors may consider Tesla stock's valuation a key part of the bear case. The company is trading at 79x earnings, so the market has already priced in an expectation for rapid growth for years to come. If competition heats up, causing Tesla's growth to slow and its margins to narrow, it could be difficult for the company to live up to its stock's premium valuation.\\n\\nBut with deliveries of its long-awaited Cybertruck expected to begin soon and the company's lead over competition only seeming to increase, Baron's optimism is worth considering. Of course, investors should take his upbeat commentary on the stock with a grain of salt since he's a large shareholder.\\n\\nBut Tesla does have a lot going for it. In addition, its valuation is reasonable when viewed in the context of its recent growth and the massive size of its addressable market.\\n\\nWhile I wouldn't bet that Tesla stock will quadruple over the next seven years, it does seem like a promising growth stock.\",\n  \"Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK -1.31%) is always rebalancing its stock portfolio. The fund sold 51,155 shares of electric-vehicle veteran Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) on Wednesday, effectively moving $14 million from that stock to video game platform Roblox (RBLX -1.77%).\\n\\nThis sale extended a long-running streak to 13 consecutive trades where the fund reduced its Tesla ownership. ARK Innovation hasn't bought Tesla shares since April 26, siphoning a total of 729,582 shares out of its largest holding during that span.\\n\\nHas Cathie Wood lost patience with Tesla, or is she simply turning some paper profits into solid cash? Let's take a look.\\n\\nTesla is still the king of ARK Innovation's castle\\n\\nFirst of all, ARK Innovation is not cashing in all of its Tesla holdings. In fact, the fund's total reliance on Tesla has stayed quite steady in recent months. Tesla accounted for 11.2% of ARK Innovation's total holdings in early June, just before the start of the selling streak. Today, the stock holds 11.4% of the innovation-oriented ETF's total assets.\\n\\nThe lower number of remaining Tesla shares is balanced out by a rising stock price. Tesla investors have pocketed a 27% return across the same period. The volatile ticker has gained 124% year to date. Under these circumstances, ARK Innovation's cash-sipping moves make perfect sense.\\n\\nTesla is on a roll, but the stock is also prone to sudden crashes. You never know when the next Tesla dip might come along, reducing the purchasing power of your Tesla-based profits. The stock's 52-week returns are actually negative right now.\\n\\nIt's safe to say that Cathie Wood and her fund managers are skimming some profits off the frothy Tesla stock in order to boost investments in other ideas. For example, this Wednesday's substantial Tesla sale was matched by a Roblox buy of almost exactly the same size.\\n\\nThis actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) targets long-term returns by investing in disruptive innovators. Tesla has earned its spot as the largest holding in ARK Innovation by steering the auto industry toward a gas-free future. The company is also a leading innovator in alternative-energy solutions, and its supercomputer for self-driving systems development could unlock new business opportunities in the artificial-intelligence (AI) market.\\n\\nWhy Cathie Wood is leaning into Roblox\\n\\nRoblox is a very different story. This stock is down 31% since Nov. 4, 2022, and ARK Innovation has been adding to its Roblox holdings in this period. Wood's active style of fund management lets her take profits on soaring success stories like Tesla while taking advantage of falling stocks such as Roblox.\\n\\nThe platform operator for massively multiplayer online games saw its skyrocketing sales growth stall last year, but the annualized growth rate is back to double-digit percentages again. Roblox stock has fallen nearly 80% from the all-time peak of November 2021, when the global inflation crisis poured cold water on growth stocks everywhere.\\n\\nDespite the constant cash investments, ARK Innovation's exposure to Roblox has declined from 3.4% to 2.9% in 10 months. If the company gets back on its feet again, Cathie Wood will look like a genius for grabbing lots of shares on the cheap. The stock could also be a falling knife in the end, tarnishing Wood's stock-picking reputation and hurting the fund's short-term returns.\\n\\nARK Invest is playing the long game\\n\\nAll things considered, shuffling some Tesla-based profit into the promising Roblox opportunity looks like a savvy fund-management move. It may not be the right idea for every investor, but this is a good fit with ARK Invest's deep-pocketed hunt for promising growth stocks.\\n\\nCathie Wood's ARK Innovation fund is keeping a tight grip on its enormous Tesla investment, scraping off just enough to place a meaningful bet on Roblox's promising turnaround story. It's a low-risk move with potentially huge long-term returns. And the lucrative Tesla position continues to generate helpful cash returns for the fund.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 7, 7, 0): [\"Stock splits were all the rage on Wall Street last summer, with companies like Alphabet, Amazon, and even Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) participating in the frenzy. Although stock splits might not significantly impact a company's valuation, they can serve a purpose, including attracting more retail investors to purchase shares at a reduced price.\\n\\nTesla, the automotive and clean energy company, is one company that might consider another stock split, as it trades for nearly $300 per share. Let's explore what happens when a company splits its stock and whether Tesla might do it again soon.\\n\\nWhat's a stock split?\\n\\nA stock split occurs when a company increases its outstanding shares while keeping the total market capitalization unchanged. To provide an analogy, imagine a pizza: Whether you divide it into eight or 16 pieces, it remains the same-sized pizza.\\n\\nIn investment terms, suppose you currently hold 10 shares of a company priced at $100 per share, and the company enacts a 2-for-1 stock split. In this case, your ownership will increase to 20 shares, each valued at $50, yet your investment remains the same.\\n\\nWhy would Tesla split its stock?\\n\\nA stock like Tesla, trading at around $275 per share at this writing, can be unaffordable for certain prospective buyers. And although several brokerages offer fractional shares, notable ones such as Vanguard do not provide this option.\\n\\nIn theory, a lower share price can make a stock more affordable for a larger pool of investors, potentially resulting in increased demand for the company's shares. This heightened demand can lead to a rise in the company's market capitalization.\\n\\nAdditionally, Elon Musk has previously claimed that a lower stock price is beneficial for attracting and keeping skilled workers. This is because it allows Tesla employees greater flexibility in handling their ownership through compensation packages or employee stock purchase plans.\\n\\nWill Tesla split its stock?\\n\\nTesla has split its stock twice over its 14 years as a publicly traded company, both of which occurred within the last three years. The most recent one, a 3-for-1 split, happened in August 2022.\\n\\nNotably, Tesla stock traded at approximately $2,250 per share when the company did a 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and roughly $900 per share when it split its stock in 2022.\\n\\nMusk hasn't made any recent public statements about the possibility of a new stock split. Additionally, when you consider Tesla's current stock price of $275 per share is lower than the price after its most recent split of $300 per share, it seems unlikely that the company will announce a split at its current stock price.\\n\\nIs Tesla a buy?\\n\\nTesla is still largely considered a growth stock, meaning it's getting priced for its impressive revenue expansion. However, Tesla is more expensive than the average stock in terms of profitability ratios like price-to-earnings (P/E).\\n\\nDigging into the numbers, Tesla's revenue jumped from $16.8 billion to $19.9 billion, or 18%, in its first quarter of 2023 compared to its first quarter of 2022. Moreover, Tesla recently released its vehicle production results for its second quarter of 2023, and the company produced nearly 480,000 vehicles while delivering roughly 466,000 vehicles. While the company won't release its full financial results until July 19, that represents a remarkable growth from its second quarter of 2022, when it produced 259,000 vehicles and delivered 255,000 vehicles, or a year-over-year increase of 85% and 83%, respectively.\\n\\nLiving up to its growth stock status, Tesla is trading at a P/E ratio of 83, which is significantly higher than the S&P 500 P/E ratio of 25. Notably, the company's P/E ratio has been incredibly high over the past five years, with an average of 206. For the investors scared off by Tesla's P/E ratio, they have missed out on a potentially life-changing return of more than 1,200% during that time.\\n\\nTesla stock isn't for the faint of heart, as its price is frequently volatile. Still, considering its past success and meteoric productivity increase, the stock is essential to any growth investor's portfolio.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 8, 7, 0): ['Gearstd/iStock via Getty Images\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nI know what everyone is going to say. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a growth stock, not a dividend stock. Similar to two other popular stocks amongst investors, Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). Along with Meta Platforms (META), these are some of the most recognizable businesses in the world. And for good reason. In my opinion they all offer investors high growth, and I view them as long-term holds. But as solely a dividend investor, which you can tell by my name, I don\\'t hold any of these in my portfolio.\\n\\nOut of the big four, only one pays a dividend, and that\\'s AAPL. I wrote an article on them last month stating that the dividend yield was too low for a stock that generates the kind of cash flow the tech giant does. I understand many investors don\\'t hold AAPL for the dividend but for the growth. Some say it\\'s not even considered a dividend stock. While I agree many investors don\\'t hold them for the dividend, it is indeed a dividend stock. It pays a quarterly dividend so by definition it\\'s exactly that.\\n\\nBut enough about Apple. I\\'m not sure if many readers remember when billionaire Elon Musk stated he wanted to pay Tesla shareholders a dividend. But I do! I was once a shareholder in the electric vehicle (\"EV\") company, but sold to focus on building a stream of income to live off within the next several years. And I know although some companies do not pay a dividend, investors often create their own synthetic dividend.\\n\\nI\\'m well aware of this strategy, and even though it may work for some, I\\'m not a fan. I buy my stocks with the purpose of holding them forever unless the fundamentals change or the stock is severely underperforming in my portfolio and I see a better opportunity elsewhere. If the EV giant does indeed decide to pay shareholders a dividend, I might reconsider buying.\\n\\nWhere\\'s The Dividend?\\n\\nIn March of 2022, there were talks that Tesla would ask at its annual shareholder meeting for an increase in the number of authorized shares in order to enable a stock split of the company. This would be the second time in 2 years, only this time so the EV maker could possibly pay a dividend. In August of the same year, Tesla completed a 3-for-1 stock split and after the dividend talks went silent.\\n\\nLittle more than a year a half later, still no dividend. And it doesn\\'t seem like paying a dividend is a priority for the company, either. To be fair, Tesla is still in its growth stages, so a dividend in the near future doesn\\'t seem all that likely. See below for Seeking Alpha\\'s dividend estimates. As you can see, the stock would have a very low yield, similar to that of Apple\\'s.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha\\n\\nCan Tesla Support Paying A Dividend?\\n\\nTo be honest, I don\\'t think CEO\\'s like Warren Buffett and Elon Musk are fond of their companies paying dividends. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is another company with a huge cash flow that doesn\\'t pay a dividend. But one thing for sure is that they love collecting them! Warren Buffett is an avid dividend collector like myself. Only difference besides the spelling of the name is the amount he collects. The amount I collect in comparison is minuscule. He has many decades of collecting dividends ahead of me. But enough about that.\\n\\nThere are many companies that pay dividends and many that do not. In the current macro environment, dividend collecting has seemingly become more attractive. With the FED still battling inflation and food & gas prices still soaring, collecting a check every week or month can help soften the blow.\\n\\nAs big as TSLA is, it still had its fair share of problems in 2022. From high interest rates to forced shutdowns. Additionally, the EV maker saw its operating cash flow decrease Q3 \\'22 to Q1 \\'23. But despite that, Tesla delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker. They also generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow.\\n\\nAnd while CAPEX has doubled over the last two years, the company has managed to triple its cash from operations during the same time. Tesla grew its CFO from $5.9 billion in 2020 to $14.7 billion at the end of 2022. In 2021 the EV maker\\'s free cash flow (\"FCF\") was roughly $5 billion. This is a testament to Tesla as a company, because having positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business, that also invests massive amount of its money into new technology, isn\\'t easy. Especially in the current environment, so it\\'s obvious they\\'re doing something right.\\n\\nTSLA investor presentation\\n\\nDividend Forecast\\n\\nHypothetically speaking, using the middle of Seeking Alpha\\'s projection, and giving them a dividend yield similar to AAPL, if TSLA did decide to pay an annual dividend of $1.37, that would equal a quarterly dividend of $0.3425 a share. With 3.48 billion current shares outstanding, this would equal a payout of almost $1.192 billion a quarter.\\n\\nTo put this into perspective, TSLA\\'s FCF for the last two quarters were $0.4 billion in Q1 and $1.0 billion in Q2. Now, I\\'m not saying that TSLA would pay a dividend that high if they did decide to pay one, I just used the annual $1.37 hypothetically because it was similar to AAPL and both are considered high-growth businesses. I assume that they would start with a very small dividend of $0.25 or less if they did decide on rewarding shareholders due to the capital-intensive nature of the business.\\n\\nSimplySafeDividends\\n\\nGrowth Ahead\\n\\nDuring Q2 earnings their CEO Elon Musk stated that the company achieved record vehicle production and deliveries, and record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. Additionally, the Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally of any kind in Q1, surpassing the Toyota (TM) Corolla. They are also expecting to deliver the highly anticipated Cybertruck in Q3. And although they are expecting Q3 production to be down due to factory upgrades, they\\'re still expecting to deliver 1.8 million vehicles this year.\\n\\nThis is an increase of 38.46% year-over-year. As you can see, TSLA has continued to increase its production and vehicles quarter-over-quarter since Q3 of 2020, and I see this moving forward. Due to rising costs in gas and the demand for electric cars, I see Tesla continuing to dominate the EV space for many years to come. By 2030 it is expected EV\\'s will omit the need for 5 million barrels of oil a day. This trend also has a positive effect on battery production and supply chains. And with investments into artificial intelligence and the Tesla Megapack, these will continue to be profitable contributors for the company.\\n\\nTSLA investor presentation\\n\\nHealthy Balance Sheet\\n\\nOne thing I don\\'t believe gets talked about enough with Tesla is their balance sheet. The amount of debt a company has can be a huge factor in dividend payments and growth. A high-quality company with too much debt on its balance sheet will most likely focus on paying it down before committing to a dividend.\\n\\nTesla\\'s balance sheet further affirms its quality, especially in the current high interest rate environment. A lot of fast-growing companies will often take on a lot of debt to fund their growth, but TSLA has avoided this which speaks volumes to their CEO Elon Musk and his team.\\n\\nOne thing that\\'s impressive is how the company has managed to increase their cash balance while simultaneously decreasing their debt load over the last year. This time frame includes the fastest rate hike in history and production of the Cybertruck. At the end of Q2 TSLA had over $23 billion in cash with just $872 million in debt. To put this in perspective, this has decreased from $2.8 billion year-over-year and from $11.6 billion in 2019. The company has essentially become debt-free over the last 4 years while maintaining positive cash flow during the same period. So if the company did decide to surprise shareholders with a dividend, one thing they wouldn\\'t have to worry about paying back is debt.\\n\\nTSLA investor presentation\\n\\nRisks\\n\\nAlthough the company doesn\\'t have to worry about refinancing a huge debt load at higher rates like many other companies, the current macro environment has affected them. High interest rates and the threat of a recession take a toll on consumer spending as seen by the high credit card debt. Recent data from the Federal Reserve showed American credit card debt soared to $1.3 trillion in Q2 of this year. Furthermore, the average credit card interest rate was 22.16% in May. And while most consumers don\\'t buy cars with their credit cards, this does show that many are allocating their funds elsewhere, which leaves less room for spending on items like Tesla cars in the near-term.\\n\\nSo in short this reduces the affordability of cars. And this has forced Tesla to lower its cost because the interest payments actually increase the price of the car. All the while things such as production costs and the price of raw materials continue to rise. Then there\\'s the expected Q3 volume decline due to factory upgrades. All of these I consider short to medium-term headwinds but headwinds nonetheless. As the economy stabilizes over the next several quarters I expect production to pick back up and the highly anticipated Cybertruck to become a massive hit with customers.\\n\\nValuation\\n\\nOne thing that has always been associated with Tesla was the word overvalued. I honestly don\\'t remember a time when it wasn\\'t. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of 71.24 at time of writing making it extremely overvalued. Exactly a year ago on September 8th, the stock was trading at $289 and has since seen its price decline by roughly 8.2%. The time to buy this stock was at the beginning of the year when it reached a price of nearly $100. With an average price target of $252 I just don\\'t think it offers investors enough margin of safety at the current price.\\n\\nWith tax-loss harvesting season coming soon investors may just get a chance add on a pullback in price, although I can\\'t see the price dropping that low. With its recent stock split history who knows, maybe the company will split its stock again in 2024. In the last 3 years the company has done two stock splits, once in 2020 and once in 2022. Known for its overvaluation, I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see another in the near-future.\\n\\nY charts\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAlthough many don\\'t invest in Tesla with hopes of the stock paying a dividend, in 2022 there were brief talks of the company paying one. Since then I haven\\'t heard talks of any kind in reference to this. It could still be a part of the EV giant\\'s future plans, I don\\'t see this happening anytime soon as the stock is focused on growth.\\n\\nAlthough TSLA is a capital-intensive business, the company has managed to grow its free cash flow and decrease its debt over the last several years, which is impressive. With two stock splits in the last three years and the continued growth of the company, maybe investors could potentially see the dividend talks come to fruition over the next few years.\\n\\nFor those looking for growth, I think TSLA is a great addition on a pullback closer to the $200 price range or with another stock split. With tax-loss harvesting season approaching soon and a looming recession, investors could see the stock\\'s price fall over these next several weeks potentially offering a more attractive entry price for those looking to invest. Although quality normally trades at a premium, TSLA\\'s P/E of 71 is unjustifiable. As previously mentioned the stock is normally always overvalued since it is very popular amongst investors. I do see the company continuing its dominance in the EV space for many years to come.\\n\\nIf Tesla, Inc. does decide to conduct another stock split and implement a dividend, I will most likely open a position. Until then, I rate TSLA a hold.\\n\\nEditor\\'s Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This was, at least, according to Musk biographer Walter Isaacson.\\n\\nCiting an excerpt from Isaacson’s upcoming book, Axios noted that Musk was so focused on self-driving robotaxis that it took the collective effort of Tesla executives to persuade him to pursue an affordable car as well. As noted by the publication, the CEO only relented when his aides revealed a plan to build both the $25,000 car and Tesla’s robotaxi side by side.\\n\\nTesla is aiming to reach 20 million vehicles per year in 2030. To achieve such a goal, the company would need a vehicle that it could build quickly at scale. This means that Tesla needs a car that would far exceed the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover in output. Tesla’s next-generation platform, which was discussed during Investor Day earlier this year, seems designed for this purpose.\\n\\nAs per Isaacson, Musk gathered his top five lieutenants for dinner in Austin for a brainstorming session in November 2021. The agenda for the day was a basic robotaxi that could be produced in high volumes. Musk and his team would reportedly end up debating for almost a year whether they should play it safe and build a car with traditional controls, or opt for a vehicle that’s all-in on autonomy, with no steering wheel or pedals.\\n\\nSeveral Tesla engineers reportedly pushed for a more conservative approach. Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen, during a meeting on August 18, 2022, even suggested that the robotaxi could be a vehicle with steering wheels and pedals that could be removed later. “If we go down a path of having no steering wheel, and FSD is not ready, we won’t be able to put them on the road,” the Chief Designer said.\\n\\nMusk, however, was reportedly adamant. “No mirrors, no pedals, no steering wheel. This is me taking responsibility for this decision,” Musk reportedly said. The CEO also highlighted Tesla’s focus on autonomy. “Let me be clear. This vehicle must be designed as a clean robotaxi. We’re going to take that risk. It’s my fault if it f–ks up. But we are not going to design some sort of amphibian frog that’s a halfway car. We are all in on autonomy,” Musk said.\\n\\nMusk would later relent, however, following a meeting in September 2022. During the meeting, von Holzhausen and several others presented data indicating that a small, “global car” would be needed for Tesla to achieve its ambitious growth targets. The team also convinced the CEO that both the $25,000 car and the robotaxi could be built on the same next-generation platform. Both vehicles could be produced using the same assembly lines as well.\\n\\nUltimately, Musk was reportedly convinced of the $25,000 car after von Holzhausen placed models of the $25,000 Tesla and the robotaxi side by side in Tesla’s Design Studio. Both vehicles were unlike other cars on the road today. As per Isaacson, both vehicles had a futuristic design that was inspired by the Tesla Cybertruck. Musk loved the vehicles.\\n\\n“When one of these comes around a corner, people will think they are seeing something from the future,” Musk said.\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

Ark Invest sold 1,884 shares of the electric vehicle (EV) stock on Aug. 15 and then sold 182,314 shares of the e-commerce services company's stock the following day.\\n\\nStrikingly, it seems that funds from the sales are being used to invest in an even more potentially explosive, high-risk growth stock.\\n\\nOn Aug. 16, Wood's company purchased roughly $16 million worth of Archer Aviation (ACHR 2.86%) shares for its Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK -1.31%). Archer is a maker of flying vehicles, or electric vehicle takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and its business is still in a pre-revenue state.\\n\\nWhat do Wood's recent stock moves say about Tesla, Shopify, and Archer Aviation?\\n\\nWood is still broadly bullish on Tesla and Shopify\\n\\nArk regularly publishes updates showing which stocks it has bought and sold. With the growth-focused investment firm's funds putting up strong performance this year, some investors have been paying close attention to the company's moves. But it would be a mistake to read too much into recent sales on these stocks.\\n\\nWhile Wood has sold Tesla and Shopify recently, it's clear that the famous investor still has plenty of confidence in both companies. Tesla remains the single-largest stock holding by weight in the company's flagship Ark Innovation ETF and accounts for 10.1% of the total portfolio weight in the ETF. Meanwhile, Shopify accounts for approximately 9.6% of the total portfolio weight in the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF.\\n\\nTesla also accounts for 6% of total portfolio weight and is the sixth-largest holding in the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF. Shopify accounts for 4.4% of the equity weight in the portfolio and is the 10th-largest holding.\\n\\nArk's Tesla sales amounted to roughly $439,000, and its $8.9 million trim on its Shopify position is relatively small in the context of its overall holdings. Accordingly, it's likely that the moves have been made in order to free up some funds to make bets on some other potentially explosive plays. Within that mold, Wood appears to be increasingly excited about Archer Aviation.\\n\\nWhy is Cathie Wood buying Archer Aviation stock?\\n\\nArcher Aviation went public in 2021 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). While the stock has seen some volatile swings since its public debut, shares have been on a tear in 2023. The company's share price is up roughly 220% year to date.\\n\\nArcher is a pioneering player in flying electric vehicles, and Wood seems to think it has the makings of a long-term winner. The recent investment in the eVTOL specialist wasn't the first Ark has made in the company.\\n\\nWith its recently published second-quarter report, Archer announced that it had secured $215 million in new investment funding from a cohort that included Ark, Stellantis, Boeing, and United Airlines. The fresh round of funding brought the company's total funding to more than $1.1 billion.\\n\\nWhile flying vehicles have long been the stuff of science fiction and futurism, it looks like the industry may finally be taking off. An estimate from Morgan Stanley suggests that the urban air-mobility market will be worth $29 billion annually in 2023 and more than $1 trillion by 2040.\\n\\nArcher is aiming to achieve FAA certification and begin commercial operations in 2025 and has received confirmation from the regulatory agency that things are on track to meet that goal. The company's Midnight vehicle has already received the FAA special airworthiness certificate -- a designation that will allow it to begin flying in U.S. airspace under limited settings and scenarios.\\n\\nThrough its deal with the U.S. Department of Defense, Archer management expects that its Midnight vehicle will become the first eVTOL aircraft to actually be delivered to a customer.\\n\\nThere certainly seems to be some promise here, but investors should keep in mind that Archer's outlook is highly speculative. While Cathie Wood is a fan of high-risk, high-reward growth plays, she isn't betting big on the company just yet.\\n\\nEven after these recent purchases, Archer Aviation accounts for a relatively small portion of Ark's flagship growth fund. The Ark Innovation ETF holds Archer stock currently worth roughly $26.1 million, which means it represents roughly 0.4% of the fund's total stock holdings.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 9, 7, 0): ['Loading...

But since the beginning of 2022, Tesla is still down 27%, which shows how far the stock fell last year.\\n\\nLet's look at where Tesla stock is, how it got here, a fair price for the stock, and where it could be headed to see if the growth stock is worth buying now.\\n\\nThe fundamentals are intact\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, Tesla stood out as the best electric vehicle stock to buy. Looking back on that argument, there's very little that has changed about Tesla as a company.\\n\\nTesla still has the best balance sheet in the auto industry. Its quarterly operating margin did fall below 10% and its trailing 12-month (ttm) operating margin is now over three percentage points lower than the 17% operating margin Tesla posted in 2022. But overall, margins are still good. And a decline in margins was expected because of price cuts.\\n\\nDespite a challenging period for automakers, Tesla is still growing extremely quickly. In the first half of 2022, Tesla produced 563,987 cars and delivered 564,743 cars. In the first half of this year, it produced and delivered 920,508 cars and 889,015 cars, respectively. That's a staggering 63% growth rate in production.\\n\\nAs for the financial performance, Tesla's ttm revenue is approaching the $100 billion mark. But profits have stagnated, impacted by higher operating expenses and capital expenditures. Overall, Tesla is doing very well, and the blemishes (lower margins and slowing profit growth) are mostly just as a result of the business cycle -- not a change in consumer sentiment toward EVs.\\n\\nFinding a valuation that makes sense\\n\\nThe thing that has changed is Tesla's valuation. At the beginning of the year, Tesla's forward P/E ratio was in the high 20s, which made it similarly valued to some top consumer staples companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Procter & Gamble -- not other growth stocks. The discount didn't last that long. And now, Tesla's P/E ratio, price to sales (P/S) ratio, and price to free cash flow (FCF) ratio have skyrocketed, along with just about any other valuation metric you want to use.\\n\\nPart of the issue is that Tesla isn't growing profits right now. And its FCF is down because it is reinvesting so much in the business. Tesla stock's run-up also boosts the P/E ratio.\\n\\nThe million-dollar question for any stock is finding a fair valuation relative to the future performance of the company. Tesla has always been a volatile stock. So it's not surprising that it can look wildly expensive or cheap at any given moment. And there's no denying it simply isn't the bargain it was at the beginning of the year.\\n\\nBut given how fast Tesla is growing, its brilliant execution, its plans for production capacity expansions, and the long-term runway for electric vehicles, the stock definitely deserves to trade at a big premium to the market.\\n\\nFocus on the P/S ratio\\n\\nRevenue may be the best number to look at for Tesla, because it encapsulates how many cars Tesla is selling rather than how much it is spending in a given short-term time frame. And ultimately, Tesla's ultra-long-term investment thesis centers around exponential production growth and becoming the largest car maker by volume in the world. So assuming Tesla maintains its strong margins over time, the price to sales ratio is the valuation metric to look at for a good buy point in the stock.\\n\\nCoincidentally, Tesla's current P/S ratio is almost exactly its 5-year average P/S ratio. But it's a lot lower than the 3-year average.\\n\\nFor a company with 50% revenue growth and an over 15% operating margin, a 10 P/S ratio is a steal. Even if Tesla's revenue growth is closer to 30% over the next five years, a 10 P/S ratio is still reasonable if it keeps its margins up.\\n\\nAs a rough rule of thumb, I'd say the buy zone for Tesla is anything below a 10 P/S ratio. But again, if Tesla's revenue growth or margins show signs of deterioration, then this level should change.\\n\\nTesla stock is a good deal\\n\\nThe beauty of a fast-growing stock like Tesla is that it can start to look very cheap if its fundamentals stay strong. For example, for Tesla to maintain the same 10 or so P/S ratio, the stock price growth would have to match the revenue growth. So if Tesla grows revenue by 50% in 2024 compared to 2023, but the stock price is the same, the P/S ratio will be cut in half and be under 5. Similarly, if Tesla grows revenue by 50% but the stock doubles, then the P/S ratio will be higher.\\n\\nThe big takeaway here is that if -- and this is a big if -- a 10 P/S ratio is a good valuation for Tesla, then the stock should grow at the same pace as its revenue. 30% revenue growth would mean a 30% gain for the stock to keep the same P/S ratio. And so on. That's a compelling reason to own Tesla over the long term.\\n\\nThe good news is that Tesla doesn't even have to deserve a 10 P/S ratio to be a good buy. Even if a 7 or 8 P/S ratio is more reasonable, Tesla stock would still be a big winner if it can grow revenue at over 30% a year. Assuming 30% growth per year would give Tesla $349 billion in revenue in five years. Slap a 7 P/S ratio on that figure, and Tesla would have a market cap of $2.44 trillion -- more than three times its current $800 billion market cap. Play around even more with the numbers, and a 3 P/S ratio would be breaking even on the investment in five years, and a 5 P/S would still come close to doubling your money.\\n\\nIn sum, Tesla is a no-brainer investment if it can do even a 30% sustained top-line growth rate. But it's growing revenue by even more than that right now.\\n\\nA growth stock worth owning\\n\\nTesla is a great buy for just being a car company. Once you start to consider all the other projects it has in the works, and the many ways it can monetize its technology -- robotaxis, artificial intelligence, solar energy, DC charging, etc. -- then the upside is too good to ignore.\\n\\nTesla isn't as screaming of a buy as it was at the beginning of the year. But until it shows signs of slowing down, there's no reason to get off this rocket ship of a growth stock.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 29, 7, 0): [\"What happened\\n\\nTesla's (TSLA -3.13%) biggest factory and biggest market is in China. Its Shanghai plant is also thought to be its most profitable. News from its biggest Chinese competitor has Tesla shares surging today. As of 1:35 p.m. ET, Tesla shares had jumped 6.3%.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nToday's move has helped Tesla shares rise almost 10% over the past week. The jump comes after China-based BYD reported record vehicle deliveries and profits that tripled in the first half of the year.\\n\\nTesla doesn't just do business in China, of course. The company has been prescient enough to expand in the U.S. and European markets as well. But its Shanghai plant can produce more than 1 million units annually and it's thought to be the most profitable.

The pricing strategy has already impacted profit margins. The big question is whether that's to maintain market share amid growing competition or to stoke demand as growth in the Chinese economy has slowed.\\n\\nBYD's report shows that demand continues to grow in China and that's the most important factor.

The company doesn't break out regional sales, but the fact that BYD had impressive sales means the market remains strong in China. Investors are signaling their approval and hopes for continued growth by boosting Tesla shares today.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 26, 7, 0): ['Given Tesla\\'s (TSLA -3.13%) extremely pricey valuation, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 75, investors need to constantly assess the likelihood of continued strong growth. A valuation like this means the price of the growth stock is based largely on future expectations for higher earnings growth -- not the company\\'s earnings power today. Fortunately, Tesla\\'s most recent quarterly update gives reasons to be optimistic about the company\\'s prospects for stronger growth. Indeed, Tesla investors may now have enough data to make a reasonable assumption that the company could see rapid growth in deliveries next year, too.\\n\\nHere are some of the main reasons Tesla will likely grow deliveries substantially in 2024 (albeit at a slower growth rate than in 2023).\\n\\nCybertruck demand is spectacular\\n\\nFirst, there\\'s Tesla\\'s upcoming launch of its all-electric pickup truck called Cybertruck. In its second-quarter update, the electric car maker reaffirmed that it\\'s on track to deliver the first Cybertruck vehicles this year.\\n\\nFurthermore, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emphasized during the company\\'s earnings call that demand for the truck is far greater than supply.\\n\\nInvestors shouldn\\'t get too excited about the potential impact of Cybertruck on Tesla\\'s vehicle-delivery volume next year. Management went out of their way to explain that it\\'s extremely difficult to forecast how well the production ramp of the new vehicle will go, though Musk said that he hopes \"it\\'s smooth.\" Additionally, he said he thinks Tesla will \"be making them in high volume next year. ...\"\\n\\nSignificant production capacity\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that there was a huge step-up in Tesla\\'s production volume in Q2, highlighting the momentum the company is seeing in manufacturing. This positions the company well as it wraps up the second half of 2023 and heads into next year.\\n\\nTesla notably produced about 480,000 vehicles in Q2 2023, up from approximately 441,000 in Q1 2023. This comes as Tesla\\'s production ramp at its new factories in Germany and Texas continues making progress.\\n\\nIn total, Tesla has installed production lines and tooling to accommodate production volume of up to more than 2 million vehicles annually. With trailing-12-month deliveries at about 1.6 million, the company has more room to grow into its installed annual production vehicle capacity.\\n\\nDelivery growth may slow\\n\\nSo, what can investors expect from Tesla next year? Strong (but slower) growth. This is because Tesla\\'s current quarterly-production volume is already nearing its installed-production capacity. In addition, some of Tesla\\'s growth next year will depend on the rollout of new production lines (like the Cybertruck production line in Texas) -- and there\\'s a lot of uncertainty associated with the ramp of new production lines.\\n\\nMaking a more specific forecast, the company\\'s strong manufacturing momentum and robust demand for Cybertruck set up Tesla for a year-over-year delivery volume growth rate likely in the high teens or even twenties next year, though growth could come in significantly higher than this if Tesla\\'s Cybertruck production ramp goes smoothly.\\n\\nNotably, some volatility in Tesla\\'s year-over-year growth rates in deliveries, however, is normal. It takes time to ramp up new products, launch new factories, and optimize deliveries for an increasingly global scale.',\n  \"When Nikola (NKLA 5.00%) went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) three years ago, many investors dismissed it as a blatant attempt to ride the coattails of Tesla's (TSLA -3.13%) success. Both companies produced electric vehicles, and Nikola seemingly adopted the Serbian-American inventor's first name only because Tesla had already claimed his last name.\\n\\nBut unlike Tesla, which mainly produces electric sedans, Nikola set out to produce electric and hydrogen-powered semi-trucks. It also planned to build a network of hydrogen charging stations for its fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).\\n\\nDuring its SPAC presentation, Nikola claimed it could deliver 600 BEVs (battery-powered electric vehicles) in 2021; 1,200 BEVs in 2022; and 3,500 BEVs in 2023. It also said it would sell 2,000 FCEVs in 2023 as it opened its first 10 hydrogen stations. But in reality, it only delivered 131 BEVs in 2022 and aims to deliver 250-300 BEVs this year.\\n\\nThat shortfall, along with the criminal conviction of its former CEO Trevor Milton for securities and wire fraud, caused many investors to abandon Nikola. But could this out-of-favor EV stock bounce back and actually surpass Tesla's market cap by 2030?\\n\\nHow rapidly would Nikola need to grow to match today's Tesla?\\n\\nNikola currently has an enterprise value of $2.5 billion, or 17 times its projected sales for 2023. Tesla has an enterprise value of $801.9 billion, which values it at 8x this year's projected sales.\\n\\nNikola is trading at a higher valuation than Tesla because it's expected to grow a lot faster if it successfully ramps up its production of BEVs and FCEVs. For now, analysts expect its revenue to soar from $51 million in 2022 to $864 million in 2025 -- which would represent a jaw-dropping compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 157%.\\n\\nThat would make Nikola comparable to Tesla about 10 years ago. Between 2012 and 2013, Tesla's revenue surged 387% from $413 million to $2.01 billion as it significantly ramped up its production of its Model S sedans. From 2013 to 2018, Tesla's revenue rose at a CAGR of 61% to reach $21.4 billion.\\n\\nIf Nikola generates $864 million in revenue in 2025 and also grows at a CAGR of 61% through 2030, it could generate $9.4 billion in revenue by the final year. If it's still trading at 17x sales by then, it could be worth $160 billion.\\n\\nBut that would still make it much smaller than today's Tesla -- which is expected to generate $100.3 billion in revenue this year. Between 2022 and 2025, analysts expect Tesla's revenue to rise at a CAGR of 25% and reach $160.6 billion. In short, there's no viable way for Nikola to become more valuable than Tesla by 2030.\\n\\nWhat should Nikola's investors focus on?\\n\\nInstead of dreaming about Nikola's chances of becoming the next Tesla, investors should focus on the company's near-term liquidity. It ended the first quarter of 2023 with just $121 million in unrestricted cash and equivalents, down from $233 million at the end of 2022, and is expected to post a net loss of $655 million for the full year. Those grim numbers suggest Nikola might not even survive long enough to ramp up its production of BEVs and FCEVs.\\n\\nTo generate more cash for its current quarter, Nikola sold $100 million of its shares at a discount to its trading price in a new public offering, liquidated its battery pack maker Romeo Power, divested its stake in its European joint venture with Iveco, and laid off over a fifth of its workforce. A recent securities rule change in Delaware also clears the way for Nikola to double its total number of shares from 800 million to 1.6 billion so it can raise more cash through stock sales.\\n\\nInvestors should see if those moves will boost its liquidity in its upcoming second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 4. If they do, potential investors can focus on its longer-term catalysts -- including its planned launch of its first FCEV in the third quarter, a recently approved $42 million grant to fund its construction of six hydrogen stations in Southern California with its partner Voltera, and a deal with BayoTech to supply up to 50 FCEVs to the hydrogen fuel and transport equipment company over the next five years.\\n\\nAll of those positive developments could help Nikola scale up its FCEV business as it ramps up its production of BEVs. It might not ever evolve into the next Tesla -- which also recently expanded into the electric semi-truck market -- but it could still generate big multibagger gains if it successfully scales up its business.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 11, 8, 0): ['Like many other stocks in 2022, Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) was ravaged by the bear market. Unlike many of these same stocks, the sell-off has accelerated in recent months. While the stock has rebounded slightly from its lows, it\\'s still down 46% since October and down 70% since late 2021.\\n\\nWhile there are plenty of reasons to conclude the decline is justified, Tesla stock is starting to look tempting at these levels. Let\\'s look at three challenges that have pushed the stock lower to see if Tesla\\'s a buy.\\n\\n1. Tesla had weak deliveries in 2022\\n\\nJust last week, Tesla announced its production and delivery results for the fourth quarter and the numbers fell short of expectations.\\n\\nThe company said it produced 439,701 vehicles in Q4 and delivered 405,278. For the full year, deliveries of 1.31 million climbed 40%, while production grew 47% to 1.37 million. Both metrics fell short of Tesla\\'s long-term goal of 50% growth. For context, Wall Street had been expecting 415,000 electric vehicles (EVs) to be delivered during the fourth quarter and 1.8 million for the year.\\n\\nPerhaps most troubling to investors was that weak performance came even as the company dangled steep discounts for potential buyers to close out 2022, offering $7,500 for those who took delivery of a Model 3 or Model Y in the final 10 days of the year. Tesla also lowered the price of its most popular models for customers in China.\\n\\n2. The Twitter factor\\n\\nIt\\'s no coincidence that Tesla stock has fallen 46% since late October, which is about the time that CEO Elon Musk appointed himself CEO of social media company Twitter -- just shortly after taking the company private. Musk was already spread pretty thin with his various duties at the other companies he runs -- Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.\\n\\nGiven the struggling economy and the challenges Tesla already faces, the enigmatic leader likely has his hands full. Some investors feel that Musk is simply taking on too much and are reticent to continue holding Tesla stock while its leader focuses so much on his latest venture. This growing lack of investor confidence will likely continue to weigh on the shares -- at least until Musk delegates the job of running Twitter.\\n\\n3. The economy is weighing on Tesla\\n\\nIf there has been one factor that\\'s been front and center over the past year, it\\'s been macroeconomic headwinds -- all of which will continue to drag on car sales.\\n\\nInflation skyrocketed last year, hitting its highest level in 40 years. The Federal Reserve responded by increasing the prime lending rates six times in 2022, in a bid to slow the economy and indirectly cool the rampant price increases.\\n\\nAs a result, everything bought on credit is more expensive, as interest rates have hit their highest level in 15 years. This pushed credit card rates to record highs and auto loan rates to an 11-year high. Furthermore, the Fed is expected to continue raising rates, which are expected to peak at between 5% and 5.5% in 2023.\\n\\nThe combination of higher prices and rising interest rates have already put a strain on consumer budgets, which will put a luxury brand like Tesla out of reach for most car buyers. In fact, data suggests that even wealthier consumers -- part of Tesla\\'s biggest customer pool -- are cutting back on spending.\\n\\nTesla stock: A compelling opportunity?\\n\\nWhile the reasons for its decline are certainly understandable, we arrive at the quintessential investing question: Is Tesla stock a buy? The answer, as with many things, depends on who you are as an investor.\\n\\nEach of the issues outlined above is short-term in nature -- as the old saying goes, \"this too shall pass.\" That\\'s not to say the stock won\\'t fall further, but calling a bottom is notoriously difficult. Investors who were excited about Tesla when the stock was priced above $400 should be thrilled now that shares are selling for a 70% discount.\\n\\nAs for Tesla\\'s valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 38, Tesla is cheaper than it\\'s ever been. However, it\\'s still selling at a premium to the S&P 500, which is trading at just over 20 times earnings. Those who fill their portfolio with value stocks are unlikely to be swayed by Tesla\\'s current sticker price.\\n\\nThe global electric vehicle market clocked in at $165 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow to $434 billion by 2028. Tesla generated $50.2 billion in auto sales through the first three quarters of 2022 and is expected to end the year with revenue of roughly $83 billion, according to analysts\\' consensus estimates, which helps illustrate the magnitude of its opportunity that remains.\\n\\nSo for those with the stomach for a little volatility, Tesla stock offers significant upside potential.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 3, 16, 7, 0): ['By\\n\\nSeemingly as a means to address concerns and criticism before they are even expressed, an initial application from Tesla has suggested that Giga Berlin’s vehicle production for 1 million cars per year can be accomplished with the same water consumption. Giga Berlin’s water consumption has been a point of criticism from opponents for years.\\n\\nTesla reportedly submitted its initial application for the planned expansion of Giga Berlin to Brandenburg on Wednesday. The application relates to Tesla’s plans to change and expand its existing factory premises. With the planned improvements, Giga Berlin should be able to produce vehicles at roughly double the plant’s capacity today.\\n\\nA spokesman for the LfU has noted that Tesla’s initial application references the company’s plans to increase its production capacity from 500,000 to 1 million vehicles per year in the future. It should be noted, however, that Giga Berlin is yet to hit a run rate of 500,000 vehicles per year at its current pace. The application was reportedly confirmed by Tesla on Wednesday, as noted in a report from rbb24.\\n\\nInterestingly enough, Tesla has noted that has “optimized planning and production processes in such a way that the amounts of fresh water previously used as a basis and contractually agreed are also sufficient for this expansion.” This is an important statement, as the electric vehicle maker is suggesting that it could produce 1 million vehicles with the same water that it takes to produce 500,000. Tesla reportedly noted that this is achievable through the complete treatment and reuse of wastewater that’s generated during the vehicle production process.\\n\\nThe issue of Giga Berlin’s’ water consumption has been a pain point for the company since the facility’s construction. Critics have argued that the area lacks water and Giga Berlin threatens the water supply of residents. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during an early visit to the Giga Berlin site, explained that the facility would be doing what it could to reduce and optimize its water consumption. Musk also stated that the EV maker will be recycling as much water as “humanly possible.” Tesla’s recent application for Giga Berlin’s expansion shows that the company indents to stay true to the CEO’s words.\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips. Just send a message to simon@teslarati.com to give us a heads up.\\n\\nTesla to produce 1M cars per year in Giga Berlin with no increase in water consumption: report'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 3, 7, 0): [\"With its position at the frontier of cutting-edge technology, Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) naturally aligns with the investment philosophy of Cathie Wood and her firm, Ark Invest. Known for its focus on innovative companies capable of disrupting established business models, Ark Invest holds Tesla as a substantial portion of its portfolio, accounting for over 8% of its total holdings, the most of any company.\\n\\nConfidence in Tesla's-long term success stems from its prowess in the electric vehicle (EV) industry as well as its embrace of artificial intelligence (AI).\\n\\nBut just how high does Wood think Tesla can soar? Well, the answer lies in the results of Ark's Monte Carlo simulation conducted last year.\\n\\nNecessary background\\n\\nA Monte Carlo simulation is a modeling technique used to forecast various outcomes by running multiple simulations based on different inputs. In the case of Tesla, Ark Invest conducted 1 million simulations, considering 38 inputs to create a comprehensive picture of the company's future performance by 2026. This simulation approach allows for a range of scenarios to be analyzed, including bullish, bearish, and expected valuations of Tesla shares.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that the simulation was conducted before Tesla's 3-for-1 stock split in August 2022 and the following breakdown adjusts the prices and results of Ark's Monte Carlo simulation to account for this stock split.\\n\\nBreaking down the results\\n\\nArk Invest derived three main scenarios for Tesla's potential stock price from the simulation. The bull case projected a price of $1,900, representing the upper 75th percentile of all outcomes. On the other hand, the bear case predicted a price of $966, reflecting the lower 25th percentile. The expected scenario took the average of all outcomes and settled at a price of $1,533 per share, representing a percent change of more than 500% from today's price of about $260, which would result in a market cap of about $5 trillion.\\n\\nOne of the significant drivers identified across all scenarios is Tesla's prospective autonomous robotaxi business. Although not released yet, this branch of business is expected to contribute 62% of the company's value, 34% of its revenue, and more than half of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the expected scenario.\\n\\nAccording to the simulation, the successful development and launch of the robotaxi service is crucial for Tesla's profitability and pace of growth. The timing of this launch plays a pivotal role in determining the company's success over the next five years, with earlier commercialization yielding more favorable outcomes. Results suggest commercialization of the robotaxi service is most likely to occur in 2024 or 2025.\\n\\nWhile an autonomous robotaxi business holds vast potential, the simulation still predicts that EV production will remain a significant driver of Tesla's success. Thanks to years of continuous profitability, the simulation predicted that capital will no longer remain a bottleneck for EV manufacturing, a crucial step to mass production.\\n\\nThe best-case scenario envisions an astounding 1,100% increase from 2022's total sales, resulting in 17 million cars sold worldwide. The bear case for EV production, while not as high, is still encouraging as it expects Tesla to reach 10 million units, an increase of more than sevenfold based on last year's production.\\n\\nAdded profit drivers not included\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that while not directly factored into the simulation, Ark Invest acknowledges the significant potential of Tesla's energy storage business and its advancements in AI. Tesla's energy business holds the potential to generate substantial value through its renewable energy solutions for both residential and commercial applications. However, the true profitability lies in Tesla's AI initiatives, which present even greater opportunities for the company.\\n\\nArk Invest believes that the recently unveiled AI as a service, powered by Tesla's Dojo supercomputer, which will allow companies to train their own AI models, could generate as much as $20 trillion in value by 2030. Additionally, Tesla's humanoid robot project, Optimus, has the potential to revolutionize various industries by replacing humans operating repetitive or dangerous tasks.\\n\\nIt is essential to note that the Monte Carlo simulations are speculative and clearly have limitations. However, the simulations provide valuable insights into the significant growth possibilities for Tesla. Considering the advancements in artificial intelligence and Tesla's position as the only profitable EV manufacturer, the company has substantial room for growth.\",\n  'It\\'s practically impossible to predict short-term fluctuations in the stock market. In fact, after the 33% plunge in the Nasdaq-100 technology index in 2022, few professional Wall Street analysts believed it would then go on to surge a whopping 40% in the first six months of this year.\\n\\nThat\\'s why taking a long-term approach is the best way to generate strong returns. It smooths out short-term volatility, and history proves the more time you spend invested in the market, the higher the probability you\\'ll make money. The Nasdaq-100, for example, has delivered a positive annual return 80% of the time since 1986.\\n\\nInvestors can track that performance by purchasing an index fund, which is a conservative -- or \"passive\" -- way to gain exposure to the market. On the other hand, investors with a higher appetite for risk might choose to pick individual stocks due to the potential for much higher returns (but also greater risk).\\n\\nI\\'m going to share two stocks below that are growing their businesses fast enough to potentially turn a $200,000 investment into $1 million over the next 10 years. But don\\'t be deterred by those large numbers -- investors of any experience level can buy these stocks today.\\n\\n1. Tesla: Autonomous driving could be its biggest financial opportunity, ever\\n\\nTesla (TSLA -3.13%) is one of the fastest-growing companies in history. It generated $413 million in revenue during 2012, and a decade later in 2022, that figure had surged 19,615% to over $81 billion. That\\'s a compound annual growth rate of 69.6%!\\n\\nElectric vehicle (EV) sales are Tesla\\'s bread and butter. It\\'s the largest manufacturer of EVs in the world, and it expects to build 1.8 million cars this year alone. CEO Elon Musk has his sights set on the long term, though, estimating the company will be producing 20 million cars per year by 2030, from as many as 12 gigafactories spread across the globe.\\n\\nBut believe it or not, that probably isn\\'t Tesla\\'s biggest financial opportunity. The company is a leading developer of fully autonomous self-driving software, and customers have already clocked 150 million miles driven using the technology in the real world in beta mode. Musk thinks it could be ready for a wider public release later this year, which could turn its entire fleet of customer vehicles into autonomous robotaxis.\\n\\nMusk says the average passenger car only spends about 12 hours per week on the road. By installing self-driving software, each Tesla customer could lend their vehicle to an autonomous ride-hailing network while they\\'re not using it, earning revenue that would be split between them and the company. That could increase the gross profit margin from the production of each Tesla from 25% today to over 70% in the long run, adding billions of dollars to the company\\'s bottom line.\\n\\nMusk\\'s expectations for this new industry are supported by bullish tech investor Cathie Wood. Her firm, Ark Investment Management, thinks the robotaxi business could catapult Tesla to a valuation of $6.1 trillion by 2027 -- or seven times what it\\'s worth today.\\n\\nBased on Tesla\\'s $86 billion in trailing-12-month revenue and its current market capitalization of $820 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9.5. Assuming that remains constant between now and 2033, Tesla will have to grow its revenue by 17.5% each year to justify a fivefold return in its stock price.\\n\\nConsidering its track record over the last 10 years and its future opportunities, all signs suggest it will blow that growth rate out of the water, allowing its valuation to cool down too. As a result, Tesla stock is a great candidate to turn a $200,000 investment into $1 million.\\n\\n2. Lemonade: Disrupting an age-old industry\\n\\nDealing with your insurance company is never pleasant, particularly when it comes to making a claim. The process can involve several phone calls and a long wait between the incident and the final payout. Lemonade (LMND -1.17%) burst onto the scene in 2016 armed with artificial intelligence (AI) and an ambitious goal to change the industry, and it has an expanding product portfolio that already includes renters\\' insurance, homeowners\\' insurance, life insurance, pet insurance, and car insurance.\\n\\nDisrupting such an enormous industry makes for a volatile journey. Lemonade\\'s stock price is down 90% from its all-time high as investors have shunned unprofitable companies over the last couple of years amid tough economic conditions, so recovering even half of that ground would almost be enough for a fivefold gain! But Lemonade has even more potential in the long run.\\n\\nThe company uses AI to interact with customers -- its chatbots can write insurance quotes in 90 seconds and pay claims in under three minutes without human intervention. Plus, Lemonade continues to release more advanced models behind the scenes to help price premiums more accurately and target the most lucrative products and geographic markets to maximize its revenue.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, Lemonade generated just $67 million of revenue in 2019, but it grew at a compound annual rate of 56% to top $256 million in 2022. That isn\\'t much of a track record given the company is still so young, but it\\'s a much faster growth rate (so far) than the 17.5% annual rate of return it needs to send its stock surging fivefold between now and 2033.\\n\\nPlus, there are signs Lemonade\\'s growth is actually accelerating. In the first quarter of 2023, revenue surged 115% year over year, which was significantly above trend. Plus, the company expects a similar result in the current quarter.\\n\\nThe market for car insurance in the U.S. alone was worth $327 billion last year. Considering Lemonade\\'s total in-force premium is just $653 million across all products right now, it has an enormous runway for growth, and it shouldn\\'t be surprising that its revenue increases at a faster rate as the company scales.\\n\\nLemonade stock is a riskier play than Tesla simply because its business is at an earlier stage. But it certainly has the potential to help turn $200,000 into $1 million over the next decade based on the evidence at hand right now.'],\n datetime.datetime(2021, 9, 20, 7, 0): ['My first Tesla was delivered on June 29, one day before the end of the second quarter (wink, wink, Tesla). So that means my husband and I have now been driving our Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus for two months. Here’s how it’s going. (Oh, and our car’s name is Nigel, since a couple of people asked.)\\n\\nThis is a follow-up to my first post, which was about becoming a new Tesla Model 3 driver. You can read that here: I just bought my very first Tesla. Here’s what happened.\\n\\nSeptember 20 update: When I wrote this update at the end of August, I invited readers to use my referral code to score 1,000 free Supercharger miles. Many of you contacted me, and I happily shared it. Now, as Electrek reported on Friday, Tesla has ended its referral program for everything except its solar roof. Boooo!!! However… it’s not gone forever. It’s just going to change. We’ll keep you updated on the referral program.\\n\\nA disclaimer: I am going to repeat what I said two months ago: This is my own personal experience, not a generalization of the Tesla experience. Others’ experiences will be different. While I have been editing stories and writing about electric vehicles for more than two years now, this is the first time that I have actually owned an electric car, much less a Tesla. I drove a Model 3 once with the fantastic Dory Larsen at Electrify the South. So I got a quick taste of Tesla Model 3s pre-pandemic, thanks to her. If you live in the Southeast US, get in touch with them – they’re there to help folks experience and learn about electric cars.\\n\\nModel 3 delivery day Photo: Michelle Lewis\\n\\nMy Model 3’s specs\\n\\nOnce again, here are the specs on my Model 3, and I’ve noted how I feel about our specs two months on:\\n\\nStandard Range Plus Rear-Wheel Drive – This was the right choice for us. Charging is no problem, as I don’t commute, and my husband’s workplace has onsite EV chargers. Plus, there is a Supercharger just 3.2 miles away (more on charging below).\\n\\nBlack and White Interior – This looks fantastic, and just as our publisher Seth Weintraub promised, it does indeed wipe clean easily. The white also doesn’t burn the heck out of my legs in the hot Florida summer.\\n\\nPearl White Multi-Coat – We still really like it. I never cared before about having a dirty car. Now I’m a fanatic about keeping our Model 3 clean. A big bird dropping hit the roof and I freaked.\\n\\n18’’ Aero Wheels – We like them. No need for 19″ Sport Wheels.\\n\\nBasic Autopilot – Confession: We haven’t played with this yet. Florida drivers are too awful and the county I live in is too stop-and-start, with heavy traffic. When we go on a road trip, we’ll give it a go.\\n\\nPay Per Use Supercharging – This is fine. We mostly charge at home.\\n\\nWe ordered rubber mats for the front and back seats, and also for the trunk, within a week of delivery because we quickly got the carpets dirty. We didn’t buy Tesla mats, as they cost a bit more than we wanted to spend. We ordered Hebron mats from Amazon, and they’re robust and stay in place.\\n\\nThe Tesla app and premium connectivity\\n\\nAs any Tesla owner knows, the Tesla app is vital. That’s how we unlock and lock our car. That’s how one checks how much charge the car has, or how the home charging is going, or turn on the AC. That’s how I can find out if my husband is on his way home without bugging him. Heck, it’s the key to our Model 3 kingdom.\\n\\nAnd I haven’t yet stopped getting my keys out of my handbag as I head for the car. Eye roll.\\n\\nA Tesla app update just landed yesterday, and it’s as intuitive as the last version. It’s a major update, so it took quite a while to download. It looks great and has lots of new features, which you can read about here.\\n\\nWe also opted to pay the $9.99 a month for premium connectivity because we really like the live traffic visualization and live satellite view maps, and music streaming is a must (see below).\\n\\nPersonal settings\\n\\nNow that we’ve gone from two cars to one – we’re cutting emissions and also don’t currently need a second car – this is a major game-changer for us. Get in the car, poke your name on the touchscreen, and the driver’s seat, wing mirrors, and other settings automatically switch to one’s presets. Now we don’t have to bicker about who didn’t put the seat back anymore. (Neither one of us ever put the seat back.)\\n\\nIt’s kinda like having two cars or your own Netflix profile. It’s the best.\\n\\nCharging\\n\\nThe Mobile Connector for home charging comes in a square zipped bag that has Velcro on the bottom so it doesn’t slide around the trunk. But since we put a rubber mat in our trunk, it slides around. No big deal. It always lands in the accessible front corner anyway.\\n\\nI got a quote from an electrician who specializes in EV home charging for a NEMA 14-50 exterior outlet, 70 feet from the electrical panel. The quote, which he based on photos I sent, came back at an eye-watering $2,110. Now, we could have insisted he come see us and probably moved the location of the outlet to cut the price down. But honestly, the 120v outlet does the job. I plug it in at the end of the day, leave it overnight, and the car is charged.\\n\\nAnd as for our electric bill – and this is not scientific, before you all debate about my lack of accuracy in the comments – last year, in the same time span of July 26-August 24, it was $278. (It’s peak summer. It’s Florida. We use Arcadia.) This year, it’s $268.10. We got a Google Nest Thermostat in April and now keep the house at the Department of Energy-recommended 78-80F. And that $268.10 now also includes home charging.\\n\\nWe also got 1,000 free Supercharger miles in our “Loot Box” because I used my 9to5Mac colleague Chance Miller‘s referral code. He got 1,000 miles, too, for referring us. If I share my referral code with someone else, then the same thing happens again. Spread the free-charging love, people. Hit me up if you want my referral code.\\n\\nUnlike the gas station, which was never fun, going to the Supercharger is super fun. I feel like I’m in the cool kids’ club. We pop into the Wawa, get ice cream or something else we probably shouldn’t be eating, and sit in the car and look at the other Teslas and their drivers (I’m nosey). We listen to music and just generally feel happy about the whole situation while geeking out on watching the screen:\\n\\nWe were at the Supercharger in Pinellas Park, Florida. Plus, there’s ice cream.\\n\\nDriving\\n\\nDriving used to be purely practical for me. Now it’s emotive.\\n\\nFor those of you who read my posts, you know I cover green energy and climate change. I recently discovered that “eco-anxiety” is a thing – and I definitely suffer from it.\\n\\nBut when I drive our car, I feel lighter and happier. I get to have fun without feeling guilty about creating emissions. For a short while, I can forget about heavy, scary things like the pandemic and sea-level rise.\\n\\nI crank up the music (see below), occasionally accelerate quickly, simply because I can, and enjoy being a “petrolhead” without the petrol. I love how I can control the car with just the accelerator and how I can safely zip past bad drivers and slowpokes. It makes me love what technology can achieve at its best.\\n\\nMusic\\n\\nI specifically headed this section “music” because we haven’t watched TV or played games yet, or even fully played with car karaoke. I don’t like watching TV in cars.\\n\\nWe exclusively use our Spotify account in the car. Or rather, my playlists, because you can’t switch accounts according to profiles, like you can with Netflix. If individual Spotify accounts could somehow be linked to individual profiles, that would be amazing.\\n\\nMusic is a huge part of my Model 3 driving experience when I drive alone. I turn the volume way up, and I lose myself in the experience of driving with a soundtrack. The sound system is great, and I can change songs using the steering wheel controls, so it’s safe.\\n\\nSentry Mode\\n\\nI don’t know if Sentry Mode makes me paranoid or if my paranoia is appeased by Sentry Mode. I have never been this protective of a car before, and I’ve owned multiple new cars. If someone goes to open their car door next to me in a parking lot, I give them the stink eye. I won’t park next to pickup trucks.\\n\\nI watch the Sentry Mode video when I return to ensure no one touched my car. I get cranky if someone drives too close. I have turned into one of those weirdos who park their cars away from everyone else’s. I’m now Nigel’s overprotective parent. Tesla, you’ve created a monster.\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\nI’m going to write about this in a separate post, but I’ll just say now that you definitely have to shop around when you switch from gas to electric. I am in an extremely expensive car insurance state — did I mention how crappy Florida drivers are? — and I saved a whopping $3,000 a year by switching insurance companies, from Geico to USAA, for the same coverage. Do your homework if you have an immediate need, and I’ll share more thoughts on this soon.\\n\\nWrap-up\\n\\nTwo months on, I love Nigel as much as the day he arrived. I’m still a newbie, and I’m excited to keep learning. You Tesla people are nuts. And I’ve happily joined your crazy club.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 21, 7, 0): [],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 26, 7, 0): [],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 13, 7, 0): ['Shares of Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) are up 102% year to date, but analysts believe the popular EV stock hasn\\'t topped out yet.\\n\\nNew Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu sees the stock reaching $300. That is about 21% above the current share price. Piper Sandler sees the stock reaching $280 based on Tesla\\'s software opportunity and what it can do for the company\\'s profits over the next few years.\\n\\nSoftware is, indeed, a big opportunity, since Tesla charges as much as $15,000 for its full self-driving car software. But its profit-earning ability runs deeper than software.\\n\\nLong-term investors should pay attention to Tesla\\'s relentless pursuit of reducing costs across the business. I believe this is still an underappreciated aspect of the company\\'s culture that makes the stock worth buying right now.\\n\\nBuilt for shareholder returns\\n\\nTesla has experienced exploding demand in recent years, but what may not get enough attention is the rapid increase in the company\\'s profit margin.\\n\\nOver the last five years, Tesla\\'s profit margin has risen from negative 20% to positive 13.7%. Revenue has more than tripled, but improving margins have driven earnings per share up an incredible 2,500%.\\n\\nThere are several ways Tesla accomplishes this, and several reasons why it should continue growing earnings and fueling a higher stock price over the long term.\\n\\nTesla designs everything in-house, which goes a long way to saving money on alternative products and materials. Tesla\\'s goal is 20 million electric vehicles per year. It\\'s a mighty target next to the company\\'s 1.3 million vehicles delivered in 2022. By reducing costs and improving efficiency, Tesla can overcome production constraints and lower prices to grow demand.\\n\\nOne way it\\'s reducing costs is building smaller factories for production of the new powertrain generation. Tesla is also designing its own transistor packages, eliminating the use of rare earth materials in its EVs, and reducing its reliance on silicon carbide, an expensive semiconductor.\\n\\nTesla is gaining manufacturing expertise that is giving it a competitive advantage. The company is even building its superchargers in house, then loading them on a truck and using a crane to install them at the destination site. By pre-building the chargers, the company saves money on deployment costs. Just one more way Tesla keeps profits on an upward trajectory.\\n\\nIn fact, Tesla\\'s lead powertrain engineer Colin Campbell said the company\\'s improving efficiency will be \"transformative for the adoption of EVs.\"\\n\\nDon\\'t underestimate Tesla\\n\\nWhen you are doing everything in-house, you are also raising the risk that hiccups in production could cause delays and uncertainty in sales. Tesla has experienced these delays before, as with the initial ramp of the Model X and Model 3. The upshot, however, is that Tesla can better maintain quality standards over the car ownership experience, which puts it in good company with Apple.\\n\\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the stock is also already pricing in a lot of growth. At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 59, Tesla isn\\'t cheap, but it likely never will be. The expensive valuation will lead to occasional dips in the stock when things don\\'t go exactly like Wall Street expects. But volatility will have to to be the price investors pay for the long-term ride.\\n\\nDespite the inevitable bumps in the road, patient shareholders should be rewarded. The stock\\'s price-to-sales multiple is at multi-year lows, and that signals the market is not giving Tesla full credit for its ability to increase margins over the long term. This should set up better returns as the company continues to reduce costs and put more EVs on the road.',\n  'We all have keepsakes. Often times, they\\'re priceless -- something you wouldn\\'t give up, no matter what price you were offered.\\n\\nAnd while stocks rarely have a deep sentimental value, that doesn\\'t mean there are some worth holding -- perhaps forever.\\n\\nSo, here\\'s why I plan on holding Amazon (AMZN -1.50%) and Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) for good.\\n\\n1. Amazon\\n\\nIf I could only own one stock, it would be Amazon. The reason is simple: Because of its diverse business segments, when you own shares of Amazon, it\\'s like owning more than one company. It\\'s like having an ownership stake in a retailer, a digital media company, a cloud provider, an AI startup, and a logistics powerhouse, all rolled into one.\\n\\nEven better, many of these segments are the best at what they do. For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) controls roughly one-third of the vast cloud services market. Amazon is growing its digital ad segment, which generated more than $9.5 billion in its most recent quarter (the three months ending on March 31) and grew 33% year over year. That\\'s to say nothing of Amazon\\'s sprawling e-commerce business, which has over 200 million Prime members.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, market sentiment is coming around to the fact that Amazon\\'s management has made tough decisions to cut costs that will result in higher profits. Estimates for this year\\'s earnings per share are up from $1.41/share three months ago to $1.58/share today. I anticipate those earnings estimates will continue to rise as more analysts begin to price in the cost savings.\\n\\nHowever, I want to own shares of Amazon for the long term because of the company\\'s massive reach and diverse businesses that should stand the test of time.\\n\\n2. Tesla\\n\\nAnother stock I plan on holding for life is Tesla.\\n\\nLet me be honest: I was wrong about Tesla. For many years, I thought the company would never produce enough electric vehicles (EVs) at the scale necessary to become a real player in the automotive marketplace.\\n\\nHowever, that\\'s all changed. Now, Tesla is producing well over 1 million EVs annually, as new factories in Germany and Texas have come online. Moreover, the company is planning on building a new factory in Mexico.\\n\\nAt any rate, Tesla has more than proven that EVs are the future of the automotive industry. And this means Tesla stands to lead the way as the world makes the transition from internal combustion vehicles to EVs. Indeed, the International Energy Agency predicts that by 2030, there will be about 350 million EVs worldwide, as opposed to the 16.5 million at the end of 2021.\\n\\nBut the reasons I have for owning Tesla go beyond the fact that the company is the clear winner in a world that will rely on EVs for transport. Tesla not only wants to make vehicles that get you around, but it also wants to change the very nature of an automobile.\\n\\nTesla\\'s full self-driving (FSD) software aims to completely alter the driving experience by removing the need for human intervention. And while critics can point out that FSD still hasn\\'t arrived, it continues to get closer to a reality. Like Hemingway\\'s adage that someone tends to go bankrupt \"slowly, then all at once,\" I think FSD will follow the same path. Once naysayers see the writing on the wall and realize that Tesla\\'s FSD will eventually come to pass, it will be hard to overlook the massive value in owning a Tesla -- and its stock.\\n\\nThe prospect of robotaxis -- which make up a big reason why Cathie Wood has a $2,000 price target on Tesla shares -- would alter the entire cost structure of owning a vehicle. After all, if a car could generate cash flow while the owner isn\\'t using it, how much would a consumer be willing to pay for it?\\n\\nIn summary, Tesla is a company with one eye squarely on the future. It continues to innovate, despite its early lead in the race to supply the world with the EVs that will make the internal combustion engine a relic. And that\\'s why I want to own its shares forever.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 21, 7, 0): ['Shares of Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) seem to mostly move in only one direction recently: up. The growth stock received another big boost on Tuesday as electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive said it is adopting Tesla\\'s North American Charging Standard (NACS).\\n\\nIn total, Tesla\\'s stock is up an astounding 49% over the last 30 days. With such a sharp rise, shareholders are in a bittersweet position in which they\\'re likely extremely pleased with their gains, but may have doubts about whether or not they should continue to hold shares of the stock. With Tesla stock trading so much higher than it was just a few weeks ago, it\\'s a good time to review the growth stock\\'s valuation and the underlying business to see if investors should take some profits off of the table.\\n\\nA tipping point\\n\\nInvestors seem to be viewing manufacturers\\' willingness to adopt Tesla\\'s charging standard as a tipping point for electric vehicles and evidence of Tesla\\'s leadership in the space. Rivian\\'s move to enable its vehicles to access Tesla\\'s charging network, starting next year, follows similar moves from General Motors and Ford Motor Company in recent weeks.\\n\\nThe view that there\\'s a tipping point occurring in electric vehicles has some substance. Consider that even though total global passenger vehicle sales contracted slightly in 2022, Tesla\\'s deliveries increased 40% year over year. Investors should appreciate this strong growth rate for several reasons. First of all, with its total deliveries at more than 1.3 million in 2022, Tesla is no small player anymore. Second, this occurred despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment and significant supply chain challenges throughout the year.\\n\\nTesla\\'s momentum has persisted into 2023, with first-quarter deliveries rising 36% year over year. Sure, the company needed to lower its prices substantially in order to offset the potential substantial slowdown in demand that could have occurred due to rising interest rates. But the fact that Tesla can lower its prices substantially is another reason to believe a tipping point for electric cars is here. Tesla\\'s more affordable fully electric cars produced in increasingly higher volumes with access to a shared charging standard sounds like a recipe for a tipping point toward more meaningful mass-market adoption.\\n\\nValuation risk\\n\\nDespite some good reasons to be bullish on Tesla\\'s business, the stock\\'s valuation is a concern. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 79, investors are pricing in strong business growth for years to come. While recent underlying performance suggests the company can live up to this valuation, the automotive market is extremely competitive. Investors should leave room in their valuation models for the risk of the capital-intensive and highly competitive automotive industry leading to potential problems in the future, including the possibility of Tesla\\'s earnings not growing as fast as anticipated.\\n\\nAccording to investment research and stock analysis company New Constructs, the market\\'s expectations for the time Tesla can maintain an edge over competitors, evidenced by its ability to earn a higher return on invested capital than its weighted average cost of capital on new investments, are simply too bullish. The firm calls this duration in which a company can sustain a lead over competition a \"growth appreciation period.\" New Constructs believes investors\\' expectations for Tesla\\'s growth duration period are too optimistic, leaving significant room for error in the market\\'s forecasts.\\n\\nWhile this is just one analyst\\'s opinion on the stock and investors should do their own due diligence, New Constructs does bring up a good point: The current price for Tesla shares bakes in some incredibly high expectations from the business over the long term. With the valuation looking expensive, it may be wise for some Tesla shareholders to sell some of their shares.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 6, 7, 0): ['By\\n\\nTo state that Tesla’s Master Plan Part 3 is ambitious would be an understatement. The document itself is an extensive call to arms for every company to embrace sustainability. It also included aspirational targets for the Tesla vehicle lineup, present and future.\\n\\nImmediately noticeable in a table presented by the EV maker was the fact that its planned compact car, a next-generation vehicle expected to be produced in Giga Mexico, is expected to see sales of 42 million units in the long term. As per Master Plan Part 3, the global fleet of vehicles in the same segment is a whopping 686 million.\\n\\nTesla bears and critics promptly pounced on the idea of Tesla aspirationally targeting sales of 42 million for a yet-to-be-released car. But it should be noted that while such a target seems ridiculous today, it is feasible. The target, after all, is most likely long-term, so it would not be achieved within the next few years.\\n\\nPlus, attaining 42 million sales of one vehicle has already been done by an automaker. Back in 2021 alone, it was reported that the ubiquitous Toyota Corolla has already sold over 50 million units since it made its debut in 1966. That’s 50 million units sold across 12 generations. Other vehicles like the Volkswagen Golf are no slouch either, with 35.5 million units sold at the time.\\n\\nWith this in mind, Tesla definitely has a chance to create the next Corolla or Golf with its upcoming compact car. There are already a number of affordable electric cars today that are priced in the same $25,000 range as Tesla’s upcoming compact EV. However, Tesla’s upcoming compact is expected to have superior range, performance, and overall value for money compared to existing players in the affordable EV segment.\\n\\nWhile the idea of a Tesla achieving the same number of sales as the Toyota Corolla seems like a pipe dream for now, one should keep in mind that the same reservations existed for the EV maker’s previous vehicles like the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover. Elon Musk has noted that the Model Y could very well become the world’s best-selling car by volume, and that’s becoming more realistic by the year. Considering that Tesla’s next-generation car is expected to outsell the Model Y by a huge margin, attaining similar sales as the Toyota Corolla definitely seems realistic.\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips. Just send a message to simon@teslarati.com to give us a heads up.\\n\\nTesla’s 42 million compact EV sales target is not as insane as it looks',\n  \"All eyes in the automotive community were focused on the Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) investor relations page this weekend. The disruptive manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs) released its quarterly production and deliveries update, which gives investors and industry analysts the chance to track how much the company grew in the prior quarter.\\n\\nAs it has done for many years now, Tesla reported growing deliveries to customers, up approximately 36% year over year. However, this came well short of CEO Elon Musk's stated goal of 50% year-over-year growth, even as the company implemented multiple cost cuts to start 2023.\\n\\nDespite this delivery growth, I wouldn't get near Tesla stock as an investor right now. Here's why.\\n\\nProduction outpaces deliveries (again)\\n\\nOne concern I have with Tesla is that its production levels continue to outpace deliveries to customers. In 2022, the company produced 55.8k more cars than it delivered. In Q1, this trend continued, with 17.9k more cars produced than delivered to customers, bringing the production-to-delivery gap up to around 74k in the last five quarters.\\n\\nThis is a basic supply/demand imbalance that has two major consequences. First, it indicates that Tesla is struggling to find enough buyers for its vehicles across the globe as it scales up its manufacturing to millions of cars a year. This is a bad sign for a company looking to become an automotive giant.\\n\\nSecond, it means that Tesla is increasingly holding vehicle inventory on its balance sheet. While that's not a terrible thing in a vacuum, Tesla's used-car prices have declined by 22.5% in the last year.\\n\\nThe EV-maker has started to slash prices for its new vehicles, as well, so all these vehicles sitting as inventory on Tesla's balance sheet are going to sell at lower prices than they would have in 2021 and early 2022. This will negatively impact the company's growth.\\n\\nEarnings about to head in the wrong direction\\n\\nThe key reason for Tesla's meteoric stock rise -- aside from generally bullish speculation from investors -- was the company's ability to keep its selling prices elevated while scaling up sales to customers around the globe. This helped the company expand its operating margin from 0% to 17% in less than three years.\\n\\nThis profit margin was much greater than other mass-production automakers. Higher margins combined with strong revenue growth led to an explosion in profit generation for Tesla. It hit $12.6 billion in 2022 alone.\\n\\nNow, its pricing power is moving in the wrong direction. Even though deliveries were up 36% year over year in Q1, the EV-maker took price cuts of 10%-15% across the board to get there. This means revenue growth is likely going to slow down to around 20% in Q1 (just an approximation).\\n\\nThat might not seem like the end of the world, but price cuts will have an even greater impact on bottom-line profitability, compared to revenue, especially right now when companies are trying to wrestle with high inflation. If Tesla's revenue grows 20% in 2023, compared to 2022, but its operating margin slips from 17% down to 10% or lower, it will see decreasing earnings this year. Lower costs could offset some margin decline, but we won't know that until the company reports earnings.\\n\\nInvestors are paying a pretty penny for the stock right now\\n\\nThe scariest thing about Tesla's stock right now is its valuation. With the company's market cap of $610 billion, shares are trading at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 48.4, based on its 2022 net income.\\n\\nThis is more than twice the average for the S&P 500 right now, even though there are flashing lights in the form of inventory builds and price cuts telling investors that Tesla's earnings are likely going to decline in 2023. Call me crazy, but this doesn't sound like a recipe for strong future stock returns.\\n\\nOf course, these might be temporary woes for a stock that has crushed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. But considering the EV-maker's huge near-term woes and a valuation that's already pricing in years of future growth, I think it's best to keep Tesla stock on your watchlist right now, even if you're bullish on its long-term prospects.\",\n  \"Teslas are already known for being sleek and fast, but there’s an even sleeker and even faster model on the way — Tesla is reviving the beloved Telsa Roadster. The original Tesla Roadster was the company’s first car and was essentially a Tesla powertrain in the body of a Lotus Elise. But the new Roadster is its own thing — and it’s been designed from the ground up.\\n\\nThe new car was first announced as a concept all the way back in 2017 and was originally set to be available starting in 2020. That, obviously, didn’t happen. But that doesn’t mean we’ve forgotten about what’s set to be the coolest Tesla yet. Here’s everything you need to know about what we now hope is the 2023 Tesla Roadster.\\n\\nRecommended Videos\\n\\n2023 Tesla Roadster design\\n\\nThe 2023 Tesla Roadster is set to be the most stylish Tesla yet, at least based on the concepts we’ve seen so far. It’ll have an aerodynamic two-door coupe design and a low center of gravity, giving it a sporty and modern look. The car will come with four seats, allowing for more passengers than the original Roadster’s two-seater setup, however, we’re not expecting the rear two seats to be particularly roomy. The car will also have more aggressive styling than the previous model and 19-inch wheels.\\n\\nThe interior design of the 2023 Tesla Roadster will also get a number of tweaks compared to previous Teslas. It’ll feature an all-new dashboard and center console, as well as improved materials, and comforts like heated seats and a panoramic roof. Unlike previous Teslas, the Roadster will seemingly offer a display built into the center console, rather than a floating display. Like some of Tesla’s other cars, the Roadster may get a yoke instead of a traditional steering wheel, though that may also come as an option.\\n\\n2023 Tesla Roadster performance\\n\\nPerformance-wise, the 2023 Tesla Roadster will be a beast. It’s set to have an impressive zero-to-60 time of 1.9 seconds from its three electric motors and a top speed of 250 mph, though that’ll likely be limited for safety reasons. The car will also have a range of 620 miles on a single charge, making it the longest-range electric vehicle in production.\\n\\nThe final piece of the puzzle is Autopilot, Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving system. The company hasn’t officially announced whether or not it’ll be available on the Roadster, but it’s likely that it will be included in some form. It remains to be seen whether Autopilot will be included by default, or if it’ll be an optional extra.\\n\\n2023 Tesla Roadster price and release date\\n\\nWhile the Tesla Roadster was originally announced in 2017 with a planned release date of 2020, that window has come and gone. At this point, we’re expecting the car to be released sometime in 2023. As for the price, it’s expected to start at around $200,000, though if you buy the car with options and performance upgrades, then it could easily cost more than that.\\n\\nOf course, by the time the Roadster does eventually come out, other electric cars may have taken its place as the fastest or longest-range, and plenty of other companies have committed to releasing their own high-performance electric cars. But the Tesla Roadster will likely still be one of the most impressive EVs out there, and a great option for those who want speed and range without having to sacrifice style.\\n\\nEditors' Recommendations\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 24, 7, 0): [\"Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) shares have crushed the market this year, up 87% (as of Aug. 21). But they've taken a breather in the past month, down about 21% since their recent high posted on July 18. Investors seem to be digesting the latest financial results in a negative light.\\n\\nThis top electric-vehicle (EV) stock currently trades at about $230. Can it reach $300 per share by the end of 2023, which would translate to a 30% gain over the next four months or so? While the near term is always full of uncertainty, it's definitely in the realm of possibilities.\\n\\nBeating analyst estimates\\n\\nIn each of the first two quarters of 2023, Tesla was able to exceed Wall Street analyst estimates for the top line, generating revenue of $23.3 billion and $24.9 billion in Q1 and Q2, respectively. Both figures showed year-over-year increases of greater than 20%, which is tremendous growth for the EV-industry leader. Tesla also delivered 889,000 cars in the last two quarters, compared to 565,000 in the first six months of 2022.\\n\\nIt wasn't all good news, though. Investors were disappointed with the company's latest margin trends.\\n\\nTesla's gross margin in Q2 of 18.2% was much lower than in the same period a year ago. This lower profitability was driven by ongoing price cuts that Tesla is implementing in order to push more volume and grow its market share.\\n\\nThe same story is happening in China. And now it looks like the EV market is going through some intense price wars that could make it difficult for Tesla to boost profits going forward.\\n\\nIt's not out of the question\\n\\nDespite the company's recent mixed financials, a 30% rise in the stock price between now and the end of the year doesn't seem like a crazy outcome. Tesla shares have skyrocketed 2,220% in the past decade, so huge upswings are common. Moreover, the stock's all-time high closing price is just under $410, which was achieved in November 2021 (split-adjusted).\\n\\nThere are some catalysts on the horizon that could benefit Tesla's stock and shareholders. The business can once again exceed consensus analyst estimates when it reports third-quarter financials in October. And if margins show signs of stabilizing, it could be a boon for the stock price.\\n\\nOn the last earnings call, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said that the company will start deliveries of its highly anticipated Cybertruck later this year. If this actually ends up happening, it could be a positive catalyst.\\n\\nBut the flip side is also true. If Tesla once again delays the start of Cybertruck deliveries and if margins were to further deteriorate, shareholders could punish the stock.\\n\\nMacro uncertainty\\n\\nInvestors might be optimistic that the stock can change its course of the past month and finish the year strong -- hopefully hitting $300 per share. But it's not as clear-cut as that.\\n\\nThere's always a lot of uncertainty present when looking at the near term, but it seems like that's elevated today, given the condition of the economy. Whatever happens with inflation, consumer spending, unemployment, and the labor market will be key factors impacting what the Fed does.\\n\\nConsequently, the macro environment can't be ignored, so investors should keep it in the back of their minds. From a fundamental perspective, Tesla could crush it during the rest of the year. The stock could still do poorly, though, due to weaker investor sentiment -- especially because it trades at a steep trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 66.\\n\\nIt's certainly possible that the stock hits $300 by year-end. But things could go the other way, too, and there's no way of knowing that outcome ahead of time. Therefore, the best thing that Tesla shareholders can do is adopt a long-term mindset.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 28, 7, 0): ['Werk in Grünheide Auffällig viele Arbeitsunfälle in Tesla-Fabrik Stand: 28.09.2023 10:35 Uhr\\n\\nIn der Fabrik des US-Elektroautoherstellers Tesla in Grünheide ereignen sich einem Medienbericht zufolge auffallend viele Arbeitsunfälle.

Last year, he said Tesla would eventually eclipse the combined value of Apple and oil giant Saudi Aramco, which implied a valuation north of $4 trillion at the time.

To quote Musk, \"It\\'s better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.\"\\n\\nGoing forward, the bull case for Tesla centers on two large opportunities: electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology (which includes full self-driving (FSD) software and robotaxi services).\\n\\nTesla is the market leader in battery electric vehicles\\n\\nTesla gained market share in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) through the first half of 2023, due in part to the Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the first quarter. The company accounted for 21.8% of BEV sales through June, up from 19% in the same period last year, and nearly seven percentage points ahead of its closest competitor.\\n\\nBetter yet, Tesla still has one of the highest operating margins in the auto industry, and Musk attributes that success to manufacturing prowess and innovation. For example, Tesla produces battery packs (the most expensive component of an electric car) at a lower cost per kilowatt-hour than other automakers, and its leadership is expected to last through the decade, according to Cairn Energy Research Advisors.\\n\\nTesla plans to press its advantage with a potentially revolutionary assembly process at Gigafactory Mexico, where vehicle production will begin in 2025. The so-called \"unboxed\" assembly process could cut manufacturing costs in half and reduce factory footprint by 40%, according to Reuters.\\n\\nSuffice it to say, Tesla has a strong foothold in the electric car market, which bodes well for shareholders. Precedence Research says electric vehicle sales will increase by 23% annually to reach $1.7 trillion by 2032.\\n\\nTesla is a front-runner in autonomous driving technology\\n\\nTesla is arguably a leader in the race to build a truly autonomous car. The company has far more autopilot-enabled vehicles on the road today, so its autonomous driving data eclipses that of all other automakers combined. And more data theoretically means superior artificial intelligence (AI) software.\\n\\nIn this case, that means FSD software, a product that creates three new revenue streams for Tesla. First, FSD can already be sold directly to drivers, and demand should increase as the product improves. Second, FSD can be licensed to other automakers, and Musk says the company is currently discussing that option with a major manufacturer. Third, once perfected, FSD software will power the dedicated robotaxi Tesla plans to mass-produce next year.\\n\\nFor context, Precedence Research says the autonomous vehicle market will increase at 35% annually to hit $2.4 trillion by 2032, and Cathie Wood\\'s Ark Invest says robotaxi taxi platforms could generate $9 trillion in annual revenue by the end of the decade. Those revenue streams could have a profound impact on profitability. Musk recently told CNBC\\'s David Faber that robotaxis could boost gross margin to 70%, an astonishing leap from 18.2% in the most recent quarter.\\n\\nElon Musk is not alone in making bold predictions about Tesla\\n\\nEarlier this year, Ark Invest published a valuation model positing colossal returns for Tesla shareholders. It detailed a bear scenario and a bull scenario, valuing the company at $4.4 trillion and $7.9 trillion, respectively, by 2027.\\n\\nSimilarly, tech analyst Gene Munster recently told CNBC that Tesla and Alphabet\\'s Waymo were the two companies best positioned to benefit from self-driving cars. That bullish take aligns with past commentary, including his prediction that Tesla could be worth $2.5 trillion by 2026.\\n\\nSo Musk is not alone in making bold predictions, but investors should never put too much weight on such prognostications. They will be better off focusing on hard facts. Tesla has a strong competitive position in several multitrillion-dollar markets, and its valuation could rise substantially if all goes according to plan in the future. Investors simply need to answer this question: Can Tesla successfully pivot into FSD software and robotaxi services?\\n\\nThose who find that idea farfetched should avoid the stock. But those who believe Tesla could disrupt the transportation and mobility industries with autonomy should feel comfortable buying the stock today. Shares currently trade at 9.5 times sales, a discount to the three-year average of 16 times sales, and a very reasonable multiple for a software and services company.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 21, 7, 0): ['What happened\\n\\nShares of Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) have fallen 9% this week as of 11:45 a.m. ET Friday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, largely driven by the market\\'s response yesterday to the electric vehicle maker\\'s second-quarter results. While Tesla\\'s quarter was technically better than expected, investors appear to be recoiling after management commentary raised concerns over a combination of margin headwinds and modest delays in scaling up production of the company\\'s upcoming Cybertruck.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nTo be clear, Tesla\\'s headline numbers were strong; revenue climbed 47% year over year (YOY) to $24.9 billion, handily outpacing estimates of $24.7 billion. Adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share also rose 20% YOY, well ahead of the $0.82 per share analysts were modeling. Tesla\\'s top-line growth was largely driven by record quarterly deliveries, leading to a 46% increase in automotive revenue. Meanwhile, energy generation & storage revenue soared 74% to just over $1.5 billion, and services & other revenue jumped 47% to $2.15 billion.\\n\\nHowever, with revenue growth significantly outpacing earnings growth and operating margin at 9.6% -- down from 11.4% last quarter and 14.6% in the year-ago period -- it\\'s obvious that recent price cuts are weighing on Tesla\\'s profitability. And while the company confirmed that \"Cybertruck factory tooling [is] on track,\" management also vaguely noted that Tesla is still producing only RC (release candidate) builds of the cutting-edge pickup at its Texas plant, leading some to speculate that it might not be able to meet its stated goal of beginning volume production early next year.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\n\"We are excited that we were able to achieve such results given the macroeconomic environment we are currently in,\" Tesla management added. \"We are focusing on cost reduction, new product development that will enable future growth, investments in R&D, better vehicle financing options, continuous product improvement and generation of free cash flow.\"\\n\\nShares of Tesla are still up nearly 150% year to date even after today\\'s post-earnings drop, so perhaps today\\'s red tape is more a case of short-term traders taking profits off the table than anything else. In my view as a long-term shareholder, Tesla\\'s bull thesis remains firmly intact. If management is able to deliver on its goal of continuing to reduce costs while fostering R&D to drive future growth and maximize free cash flow generation, I suspect today\\'s pull-back will be little more than a blip in Tesla\\'s long-term story.',\n  'Tesla is finally allowing owners to transfer their FSD package to a new car, but the offer is only valid for new orders placed in the third quarter, and owners must trade in their old vehicle to Tesla\\n\\nTesla owners who splurged on the company’s lackluster Full Self-Driving package will soon be able to transfer the software package to a new car. However, like most deals from Tesla, this one has a couple of catches.\\n\\nTesla has been selling the Full Self-Driving package since 2016 and had long promised that it had all the necessary systems to achieve fully-autonomous driving without supervision. Many suckers fell victim were convinced that Tesla could deliver on this promise and splurged on the package. Prices for it have soared in recent years to the point where the package now costs $15,000 in the U.S. despite it remaining limited some seven years after its launch.\\n\\nThen there’s also the issue of Tesla not allowing those who purchased the full-self driving package to have it transferred to a new Tesla should they choose to upgrade. Instead, it stays with the car. However, during the carmaker’s most recent earnings call with investors, Elon Musk announced that Tesla will allow existing owners with FSD to transfer the package to a new car but only if they place a new order this quarter.\\n\\nadvertisement scroll to continue\\n\\nIn addition, owners must use Tesla to trade in their old vehicle if they want to have the FSD transferred to their new vehicle. If they were to sell their old Tesla on the used market, for example, then they’d have to fork out another $15,000 to get FSD on their new vehicle. Additionally, Tesla is known for ridiculously low trade-in offers, so it may not be as good of a deal as it first seems.\\n\\nRead: Tesla Offers Just $3,900 Extra On Trade-In For Full Self-Driving Feature That Costs $15,000 In New Cars\\n\\nThere’s no doubt that through this offer, Tesla is hoping to drive up sales by encouraging existing owners to upgrade to new vehicles while selling their old ones to Tesla, which will then sell them for profit. However, it’s not clear why Musk said the offer will only be valid for new orders placed in the third quarter.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 30, 7, 0): ['With its ceaseless innovation, record-breaking achievements, and the leadership of CEO Elon Musk, Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) is a company that never fails to captivate. As another quarter comes to a close and Tesla continues to reach new heights, it becomes even more vital for investors, both current and potential, to gain clarity on the company\\'s trajectory.\\n\\nHere are five key aspects that shed light on the enigma that is Tesla, guiding investors toward a deeper understanding of the world\\'s most successful electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer.\\n\\n1. More records broken\\n\\nIn Q2 2023, Tesla achieved another record-breaking quarter, hitting new milestones in deliveries, production, and revenue. The company produced an impressive 479,700 vehicles during this period, representing an 85% increase year over year (YoY). Just three years ago, Tesla\\'s production hovered around a measly 82,000 cars.\\n\\nSimilar to production, Tesla delivered 466,140 vehicles, another record for the company. Because EVs make up the bulk of the company\\'s operations, Q2 revenues also soared, growing by 47% YoY and reaching an all-time high of $24.9 billion.\\n\\n2. Margins slip\\n\\nWhile there were plenty of accomplishments this past quarter, Wall Street focused on one aspect in particular -- declining profit margins. Tesla\\'s gross margins decreased to 18.2%, down from 25% in Q2 2022 and 19.3% in the previous quarter.\\n\\nThe decrease can be attributed to a handful of factors. Most notably was the impact of inflation and rising interest rates, an issue evident across the automotive industry, and Tesla was no exception. To combat this, Tesla cut prices on various models six times this year to stimulate demand, but inevitably cut into profits. Additionally, Tesla also had to contend with increasing costs on commodities, manufacturing, and logistical expenses.\\n\\nHowever, one significant factor contributing to diminishing margins was its substantial investment in research and development (R&D). Tesla allocated a record-breaking $943 million to R&D during the quarter, emphasizing the company\\'s focus on staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technology.\\n\\n3. Near-term goals\\n\\nIn the more immediate future, Tesla\\'s top priority is to cut costs. Stated numerous times in the most recent earnings call, Tesla is \"hyper-focused\" on reducing expenses and then using those funds to reinvest in research and development, particularly in AI projects.\\n\\nAdding to its prioritization of R&D, Tesla has set ambitious goals to solidify its position as a dominant force in the automotive industry. With a target to produce 1.8 million cars this year, the company is on track to achieve yet another record if it can keep up its current pace.\\n\\nMoreover, Tesla is eagerly gearing up to deliver the highly anticipated Cybertruck in the coming months. The excitement surrounding the Cybertruck is immense. As Musk put it on the earnings call, \"Demand is so -- so far, off the hook, you can\\'t even see the hook.\"\\n\\n4. Long-term goals\\n\\nOne of the more ambitious goals of Tesla is its target to produce 20 million cars by 2030. To aid in achieving this milestone, Tesla is focused on the construction of new factories. The most current project is the Gigafactory in Nuevo León, Mexico, which is expected to be operational by next year. The company is also in the early stages of potentially expanding into India.\\n\\nIncreasing production is vital for Tesla\\'s value, but Musk foresees the development of autonomous driving and a subsequent robotaxi service as the most crucial objective for Tesla\\'s long-term success, citing \"quasi-infinite demand.\"\\n\\nBefore launching a robotaxi service, Tesla first needs to create its full self-driving software, a task that will require investing \"north of a billion dollars\" in its supercomputer Dojo to help train neural networks. Musk is optimistic about making this vision a reality and expects Tesla will achieve this groundbreaking feat by the end of the year.\\n\\n5. What Musk thinks\\n\\nIn the eyes of Elon Musk, short-term challenges that Wall Street seems to be fixated on are mere bumps on the road to Tesla\\'s grand vision. Musk believes that the potential for Tesla\\'s growth is immense, with the possibility of achieving anywhere from 5x to 10x from its current standing.\\n\\n\"The short-term fluctuations in gross margin and profitability are insignificant in comparison to the long-term picture,\" Musk stressed, adding, \"Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly.\"\\n\\nMost importantly, Musk views Tesla\\'s financial position as \"ridiculous\" due to its rare ability to maintain free cash flow despite the cost-intensive nature of EV production. This strength enables Tesla to sustain investments in cutting-edge technologies that have driven its remarkable success for years to come.',\n  'When it comes to building a successful investment portfolio, identifying stocks with long-term potential is key. Investors who seek out companies on the frontier of groundbreaking industries often find themselves at the forefront of profitable trends. It is equally important for these companies to demonstrate robust financial health, possess distinct competitive advantages, and prioritize continuous innovation.\\n\\nIn this article, we will explore two companies that fit these criteria, positioning themselves as potential all-stars in the making: Coinbase (COIN -4.09%) and Tesla (TSLA -3.13%). Both have shown resilience and agility in navigating their respective industries, making them promising contenders for investors seeking high-growth opportunities.\\n\\nCrypto\\'s clear-cut leader\\n\\nSince its highly anticipated debut on the Nasdaq, Coinbase has faced a challenging journey. The initial excitement surrounding its IPO quickly faded as a severe bear market engulfed the crypto asset class. As a result, Coinbase\\'s top line plunged by more than 75% at the end of 2022 as its primary source of revenue -- transaction fees -- dried up due to declining investor interest in cryptocurrencies. However, in response to those challenges, Coinbase has undergone significant transformations and proved resilient in overcoming hurdles.\\n\\nIn an effort to diversify its revenue stream, Coinbase expanded its \"subscriptions and services\" segment, which now contributes half of its revenue. This segment includes custodial services, staking, and interest-earning products. By reducing its reliance on transaction fees, which at one point provided nearly 95% of its net revenue, Coinbase has transformed its business model to adapt to market conditions and create new growth opportunities.\\n\\nAdding to new sources of revenue, Coinbase recently launched its \"Go Broad, Go Deep\" global expansion strategy. Recognizing the opportunity to grow its international presence, Coinbase has brought its flagship subscription service, Coinbase One, to 34 countries. In addition, it released the Coinbase International Exchange, a platform that allows institutional investors to trade perpetual futures contracts. This type of leveraged trading is extremely popular and makes up as much as 75% of global cryptocurrency activity.\\n\\nMoreover, the company has significantly reduced expenses and optimized its operations. Today, it is on the verge of turning a profit -- the closest it has been to doing that since Q4 2021 when it brought in $840 million in net income. Coinbase\\'s net loss totaled $79 million in the first quarter, down from $430 million in the prior-year period, and favorable tailwinds seem to be forming. A potential victory in its battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a rebounding crypto market, and growing interest from Wall Street firms could position Coinbase to return to prominence. With its stock price still down more than 73% from its peak, this could be a golden opportunity for long-term bargain hunters.\\n\\nDriving the autonomous future\\n\\nTesla continues to stand out from the crowd with its unparalleled track record as the sole profitable electric vehicle (EV) company. Like clockwork, its most recent earnings report once again reaffirmed its position at the top of the industry.\\n\\nDuring the second quarter, Tesla produced 479,700 vehicles, a new record for the company and up 85% year over year. Furthermore, the company delivered 466,140 vehicles, another record. Revenues soared 47% to an all-time high of $24.9 billion.\\n\\nDespite those strong headline numbers, Wall Street expressed concern over Tesla\\'s shrinking profit margins, and the stock is down 12% following the report. The company\\'s gross margin dipped to 18.2%, down from 25.0% in the year-ago quarter and 19.3% in the first quarter. These declining margins have come as the company cut prices on its vehicles in the face of growing EV competition, inflation, and rising interest rates.\\n\\nBut Tesla still enjoys some of the highest margins in the auto industry, and CEO Elon Musk stressed during the latest earnings call, \"The short-term fluctuations in gross margin and profitability are insignificant in comparison to the long-term picture,\" before adding that achievement of autonomous driving \"will make all of these numbers look foolish.\"\\n\\nTargeted for completion by the end of the year, the unveiling of fully autonomous driving means Tesla\\'s true potential might just be in its infancy. With EVs offering full self-driving capabilities, Musk\\'s vision for a Tesla robotaxi service would attract \"quasi-infinite demand,\" and that opportunity stands as the company\\'s biggest priority.\\n\\nZooming out even further, Tesla maintains positive free cash flow despite the inherently cost-intensive nature of EV production, a feat Musk describes as \"ridiculous.\" Tesla\\'s financial strength is one of its most distinct competitive edges, providing the company with the capacity to continue its investments in cutting-edge technologies that have been instrumental to its success. With this powerful combination, Musk believes the company could expand by five to 10 times from its current levels.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 22, 8, 0): [],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 17, 7, 0): [\"In 2016, Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) CEO Elon Musk first revealed plans to develop a fully autonomous self-driving robotaxi. While it's still not on the road seven years later, he just hinted it's closer than ever -- it might even be ready this year.\\n\\nIn a wide-ranging interview with CNBC's David Faber yesterday, Musk added a little more color to his vision for the project, and serving as a self-driving ride-hailing platform appears to be a big part of the value proposition.\\n\\nThe undisputed global ride-hailing leader today is Uber Technologies (UBER -4.08%), which is currently working on its own self-driving technology. But with a giant like Tesla entering the space, should Uber be worried?\\n\\nTesla's robotaxi could become its greatest value creator\\n\\nTo be clear, the robotaxi won't necessarily be a new Tesla model. Instead, Musk's goal is to have as many customer-owned Teslas serving as robotaxis as possible by having them install the company's self-driving software.\\n\\nIn the interview, he talked about how the average passenger car is used for just 10 to 12 hours per week, spending most of its time parked at its owner's home or place of work, which makes the value proposition incredibly inefficient. By installing autonomous software, those vehicles could spend that idle time out on the road as part of a ride-hailing network, earning money for both the owner and for Tesla.\\n\\nMusk touched on the potential business model, describing a revenue split that could run 50/50 or even 70/30 in favor of the car owner. This could absolutely transform Tesla's financials, because instead of just manufacturing a vehicle and selling it with a gross profit margin of 25%, each car would potentially earn a margin of 70% (or higher) over time.\\n\\nWhat could that translate to in dollar terms? Musk referenced the analysis of Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Investment Management, which issued some projections earlier this year suggesting autonomous ride-hailing could generate $4 trillion in revenue by 2027. It could also create $14 trillion in enterprise value in the process.\\n\\nThat's why the robotaxi also underpins Ark's $2,000 price target for Tesla stock in 2027, which is the highest on Wall Street. Ark predicts the autonomous platform will be responsible for 67% of the company's $6.1 trillion in enterprise value by that time -- if that were true today, it would be the single most valuable piece of technology in the world.\\n\\nUber might already have a head start\\n\\nTesla's autonomous driving software is widely considered to be the most advanced in the industry, with 2.7 million cars on the road specifically collecting data, which is 10 times more than its closest competitor.\\n\\nBut Uber has a huge advantage in its digital platform, with over 130 million monthly users, who completed 2.1 billion rides in the first quarter of 2023 alone. Since human drivers are the company's largest expense, an autonomous solution would simply represent the natural progression of its business model.\\n\\nUber has a difficult history with autonomous technology, having abandoned its in-house development project in 2020 after one of its test vehicles killed a pedestrian a couple of years earlier. However, last year, it signed a 10-year deal with a company called Motional, which is a joint venture between Korean automotive giant Hyundai and mobility technology company Aptiv.\\n\\nMotional has developed a driverless platform on top of Hyundai's Ioniq 5 electric vehicle. It has achieved SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Level 4, which means the vehicle is fully autonomous and can handle all driving and navigational tasks without human input. Motional was missing a ride-hailing ecosystem, which is what Uber brings to the table.\\n\\nTogether, the companies could theoretically deploy the largest autonomous ride-sharing network in the world.\\n\\nThe Tesla-Uber battle will be epic\\n\\nElon Musk hinted that Tesla will adopt a closed-loop ecosystem when it comes to its autonomous platform. In other words, self-driving Teslas can only operate within Tesla's ride-hailing network -- they can't be used to work for Uber, for example.\\n\\nThat effectively ensures the company earns income from its software in perpetuity. If new electric vehicles do completely displace sales of internal combustion vehicles and Tesla remains the most popular electric vehicle brand, this closed-loop strategy could quite literally be worth trillions of dollars.\\n\\nOn the other hand, as I mentioned, Uber has a major head start with users. Will everyday non-Tesla owners download another smartphone application just so they can specifically hail a Tesla? That's the biggest question. Tesla might have an abundance of supply on the road, but if users prefer to stick with Uber, it won't be very successful.\\n\\nFor that reason, it's too early for Uber to fear this impending threat, especially if it delivers a comparably good autonomous solution through its partnership with Motional. If investors want to hedge their bets, this emerging industry is a good-enough reason to buy both Tesla and Uber stock.\",\n  'By\\n\\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed the estimated production capacity the automaker will allocate to the highly anticipated Cybertruck.\\n\\nAs is typical for any Tesla event, the most interesting and exciting information shared at yesterday’s shareholder meeting came from the question and answer segment, in which shareholders inquired about everything from the Cybertruck to the Optimus robot project. During the Q&A segment, one of the most exciting pieces of information shared by the Tesla CEO was regarding Cybertruck production estimates.\\n\\nDuring the final half-hour of the Q&A segment, Elon Musk revealed that Tesla could produce anywhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Cybertrucks annually. However, it should be noted that no timeline was provided on when this would be achieved.\\n\\n(Video begins at Cybertruck production estimate question)\\n\\nAs pointed out by the Tesla CEO numerous times, Cybertruck’s production hinges on a critical factor, demand. While it seems obvious that the Tesla Cybertruck will have an enormous amount of demand in the United States, which has long been a truck-dominated car market, the scale of that demand will quickly help determine the number of resources and funding made available for Cybertruck production.\\n\\nSadly, even with the upper estimate of 500,000 trucks produced per year, with well over 1 million estimated reservations, Cybertruck reservation holders are likely still in for a long wait before the vehicle gets to their driveway. However, with specifications and pricing due to be announced as soon as next quarter, it may be worth the wait.\\n\\nLuckily, there is plenty of good news to go along with the potentially hampered production expectations. Most notably, with Tesla’s now extensive experience with production growth, the Cybertruck could achieve a production ramp unseen on any previous Tesla model. Moreover, with an all-new “exo-skeleton” confirmed to be coming on the truck, it could be far easier to produce than any truck in modern history.\\n\\nWhat do you think of the article?

One of the first big tech companies to report was electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (TSLA -3.13%). The company disclosed its second-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers a couple of weeks before earnings, crushing Wall Street expectations.\\n\\nIt didn't take long for investors to start cheering and buying up the stock. On the one hand, the company's encouraging production figures could signal strong consumer demand, an otherwise healthy signal in a rising interest rate environment. On the other hand, higher-than-expected deliveries could very well be the result of Tesla's aggressive price cuts. Should this be the case, investors need to be careful and not become enamored with strong top-line results. Price cuts will directly impact Tesla's margins and cash flow.\\n\\nIn this article I will break down the company's Q2 earnings report, highlighting the good and the not so good. Let's dig in and assess if now is a buying opportunity for Tesla stock.\\n\\nA hard look at the financials\\n\\nFor the quarter ended June 30, Tesla's automotive revenue was $21.3 billion, up 46% year over year. While this is impressive growth in a cloudy economic environment, all eyes were on the company's automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits it receives from the government.\\n\\nFor the second quarter, Tesla's automotive cost of sales was $17.2 billion, and the company booked $282 million of regulatory credits. When removing these credits, Tesla's normalized automotive revenue was $20.9 billion. This implies gross margin excluding credits of 18.1%. To put this into perspective, Tesla's automotive gross margin excluding credits was 19% in Q1, and well above 20% in the latter half of 2022.\\n\\nOne of the silver linings of the earnings report was Teslas oft-overlooked energy business. For the quarter ended June 30, Tesla's energy (battery) segment reported $1.5 billion in revenue, up 74% year over year. Additionally, the energy unit's gross margin was 18.4%. To put this into perspective, the energy segment's gross margin was 11% in Q2 2022.\\n\\nIt's pretty obvious that Tesla's price cuts have been a double-edged sword, resulting in higher year-over-year revenue while also compressing margin. However, the growing energy business helped make up for some of this margin deterioration, as Tesla has still managed to generate $1 billion in free cash flow in Q2. Moreover, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.91 beat the Wall Street consensus estimate of $0.82.\\n\\nBulls and bears couldn't be further apart\\n\\nPer usual, following the earnings report Wall Street analysts published updated reports and price targets. Two reports in particular from Wedbush Securities and Roth Capital stand out.\\n\\nRoth Capital's Craig Irwin slapped Tesla with an $85 price target, citing increased competition from other EV manufacturers, coupled with rising skepticism that some of the company's new vehicles will be a success.\\n\\nOn the other side of the table was Wedbush Securities' analyst Dan Ives. Ives is one of the biggest Tesla bulls on Wall Street. Following Q2 earnings, Ives raised his price target to $350 per share, which would imply roughly 30% upside from Tesla's current trading levels.\\n\\nIves doubled down on his view that cutting prices to spark demand was a smart move, and he believes that margins are actually stabilizing. Moreover, he is bullish that Tesla is well on its way to becoming an artificial intelligence (AI) company. The rationale behind this logic is that during the earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted that the company is in early discussions with another original equipment manufacturer to license its autonomous driving technology, dubbed full self-driving (FSD).\\n\\nLooking at the big picture\\n\\nBy any traditional valuation metric, Tesla stock looks supremely expensive compared to other car companies. But in Ives' opinion, the prospects of Tesla's car business coupled with its inroads on the AI frontier make for a compelling story. He uses a sum-of-the-parts analysis to derive an estimated price target.\\n\\nEssentially, this methodology values all of Tesla's businesses individually. When you look at Tesla as more than just a car company and account for the battery business and its potential to disrupt AI, it becomes more interesting.\\n\\nAnother longtime Tesla bull, wealth manager Ron Baron, believes Tesla could be worth $1,500 per share by 2030 -- which would make the company worth several trillion dollars. While the near-term outlook may still be a little hazy due to the broader economy, Tesla's Q2 results shed light on the long term.\\n\\nThe company is crushing the competition and doing so in a profitable way. Moreover, the budding energy unit and FSD progress really excites me. By dollar-cost averaging into the stock over time, you can easily build a nice position and hold on to the stock long term. Should Tesla reach a trillion-dollar valuation, you'll be happy you took advantage of this opportunity to buy the dip.\",\n  'By\\n\\nTesla outsold Toyota in California in the second quarter of 2023 by nearly 2,000 units, overtaking the automaker in terms of total registrations. The dominance was driven by the Model 3 and Model Y.\\n\\nTesla registered 69,212 cars throughout the second quarter of the year, while Toyota managed to obtain 67,482 registrations through the same timeframe.\\n\\nThe importance of Tesla overtaking a mass-producing automaker in its most popular U.S. market is massive. Tesla’s goal since the beginning of the company has been to make EVs affordable and take market share from gas competitors.\\n\\nToyota dominated market share during the same period in 2022, with 18.1 percent of the total car market in California. However, Tesla has managed to catch up with a 62.3 percent increase in sales in Q2 2023 compared to the same quarter last year.\\n\\nThe two companies are well above Honda, which captured the third-most registrations for the quarter at 9.7 percent. Tesla, at 14.6 percent, and Toyota, at 14.2 percent, were first and second.\\n\\nTesla has sold 123,482 cars to date, which is outshined by only Toyota. This was the first quarter that Tesla managed to outsell Toyota, and a strong first half has the Japanese company with nearly 10,000 more registrations than Tesla through the first six months.\\n\\nTesla also managed to capture several spots on the “Top Selling Models in Each Segment” list, as the Model 3 blew the competition away in the “Near Luxury” category. 41,718 registrations were enough for a 50.8 percent share of that category. The Lexus ES was second with 4,422 registrations at 5.4 percent.\\n\\nThe Model S was third in the “Luxury and High-End Sports Cars” category, trailing the BMW 5-Series and the Mercedes EQS Sedan.

Shares in the electric vehicle (EV) giant have grown by a jaw-dropping 1,263%, dwarfing the S&P 500\\'s return of just 54% over the same period. While the automaker faces near-term challenges from rising competition and an industry price war, its future might be even brighter than its past. Let\\'s dig deeper into what the next five years could look like.\\n\\nTesla could eventually win the price wars\\n\\nCompetition in the EV industry is rising as start-ups compete with established automotive brands to capitalize on the fast-growing opportunity. For Tesla, this has led to price wars and margin pressures. In the second quarter, the company\\'s operating margin fell from 14.6% to 9.6% as management slashed prices across its vehicle lineup.\\n\\nIn the near term, this is a headwind for Tesla\\'s stock because lower margins can mean lower profits, even if revenue keeps growing. But long-term investors should remember the big picture.\\n\\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs expect EVs to make up half of global new car sales by 2035 -- with the percentage rising above 85% in the U.S. and European Union. As of 2022, EVs represent just 14% of global new car sales, so the industry is still relatively young. It makes sense for Tesla to sacrifice near-term profits to maximize long-term market share. The company\\'s scale and profitability will also help it outcompete loss-making rivals like Rivian or Lucid.\\n\\nTesla\\'s management plans to cut prices on next-generation vehicles by half through technological improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. If successful, these efforts could free up room for more price cuts while protecting Tesla\\'s margins.\\n\\nEnergy storage could become a key growth driver\\n\\nIn Tesla\\'s 2023 Investor Day presentation, management highlighted a vision of becoming more than just a car company -- expanding into more forms of clean and renewable energy. Over the next five years, the most promising non-automotive business vertical might be energy storage and generation. This segment involves selling and installing solar panels, and stationary batteries for residential and commercial clients.\\n\\nIn the second quarter, Tesla\\'s energy segment generated $1.5 billion in sales -- around 6% of total revenue. But with a year-over-year growth rate of 74%, the business is expanding faster than automotive and services, which grew at rates of 46% and 47%, respectively.\\n\\nOver the long term, energy may become a larger percentage of Tesla\\'s revenue, supporting top-line growth and giving it much-needed diversification. Management is investing heavily in the opportunity by building out production infrastructure. In April, the company announced plans for its second \"megafactory\" in Shanghai, China designed to produce 10,000 storage batteries annually. The project could help lower costs and increase the availability of Tesla\\'s energy products.\\n\\nIs it too late to buy the stock?\\n\\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 62, Tesla\\'s stock is far from cheap, especially considering the near-term pressure it could face from price wars as industry competition heats up. That said, investors with a long-term time horizon should focus on the electric automaker\\'s tremendous growth rate and convincing strategy to dominate the EV mass market over the next five years and beyond.\\n\\nDespite its almost $900 billion market cap, Tesla is still a quintessential growth stock that is far from reaching its full potential, especially as new business verticals like energy storage pick up speed. You get what you pay for in the stock market. And often, the companies with the best prospects trade for a corresponding premium. Tesla is no exception.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 23, 7, 0): [\"Last week was a positive one for investors, with the Nasdaq-100 technology index jumping by 3.3%. But it was even better for shareholders of electric vehicle (EV) powerhouse Tesla (TSLA -3.13%), because that stock surged 7.5%.\\n\\nThe strong gain followed the company's annual meeting and CEO Elon Musk's interview with CNBC journalist David Faber, where he shared a number of Tesla updates and even revealed some information investors hadn't heard before. Here are five of the biggest takeaways, and they might even convince you to buy the stock.\\n\\n1. Elon Musk is about to spend more time at Tesla\\n\\nLast year, Musk acquired social media platform Twitter in an enormous deal worth $44 billion. He has served as the company's CEO ever since, navigating a very difficult period where he says it was just months away from bankruptcy. But now that the situation has stabilized, he's ready to step away from the executive role.\\n\\nOn May 12, Musk announced he'd hired longtime media executive Linda Yaccarino to be Twitter's new CEO. It will free up a significant amount of his time, and on CNBC he revealed plans to spend more time at Tesla with a specific focus on its artificial intelligence (AI) projects.\\n\\n2. Tesla is going to start advertising for the first time\\n\\nTesla has never had a demand problem before. In fact, it had an estimated order backlog of 68,700 units at the end of April. That figure is falling, but it's important to remember that the company is operating in a very difficult economic environment right now. As a result, it has cut prices on its vehicles six times this year (followed by one price rise).\\n\\nMusk is now interested in advertising for the first time ever. He says Tesla ads should be informative but artistic, with a focus on dispelling common misconceptions that its vehicles are expensive when, in fact, they sell for below the average cost of a new car in America. Musk also wants to highlight the work Tesla has done on the safety front.\\n\\nAdvertising campaigns could attract new customers who aren't yet sold on the idea of owning an electric vehicle, much less a Tesla.\\n\\n3. Tesla could (theoretically) sell cars for zero profit on purpose!\\n\\nThanks to its innovative manufacturing process and its first mover advantage in the electric vehicle market, Tesla can produce cars at a much higher gross profit margin than other automakers (whether electric or internal combustion-powered).\\n\\nIts gross margin came in at 19.3% in the recent first quarter of 2023 even after the price cuts, which was still comfortably higher than Ford's (F -1.65%) 15% and General Motors' (GM -1.59%) 13%. In the past, Tesla's automotive gross margin was as high as 32.9%.\\n\\nSo why would Musk say the company could sell cars for no profit in the future? Well, it's simply a thought exercise and probably won't happen, but he pointed out that Tesla is the only automaker on track to deliver fully autonomous self-driving software.\\n\\nSoftware products generally carry a gross margin of between 70% and 80%, so if the company sold each car at breakeven, it would still make a significant profit when each customer installs the autonomous technology. But there's more...\\n\\n4. Autonomous driving could come in 2023, and it will change everything\\n\\nYou might be wondering whether a large number of customers would actually want self-driving capabilities in their Tesla. But according to Musk, it's about more than just convenience.\\n\\nHe says the typical passenger vehicle is only used around 10 to 12 hours per week, spending most of its time parked at the owner's home or workplace. By installing autonomous driving software, that vehicle could spend 50 hours per week serving as a robotaxi and earning money in the process. This business alone could drive the gross margin of each Tesla to as high as 70% over time!\\n\\nMusk says Tesla would split revenue 50/50 or potentially even 70/30 in favor of the car owner when robotaxis become a reality, which could be as soon as this year.\\n\\nThere is typically a collision for every 500,000 miles driven in the U.S. -- but for a Tesla running the latest full self-driving beta, there's a collision for every 3.2 million miles driven. In other words, an autonomous Tesla is statistically much safer than a human driver, so a widespread release could be around the corner.\\n\\n5. Cathie Wood's Tesla analysis is the best Musk has seen\\n\\nTesla is one of the most followed stocks on Wall Street, but Musk says the recent analysis by Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Investment Management is the best he's seen.\\n\\nAccording to Ark's simulations, there's a 55% chance Tesla's robotaxi will be ready for commercial operation either this year or in 2024. It estimates customers are currently driving around 1 million miles per day in full self-driving mode with the beta version, which helps to train and constantly improve the AI models.\\n\\nThe firm believes Tesla will amass $6.1 trillion in enterprise value by 2027, with its new robotaxi business accounting for 67% of that total. It would make the company one of the dominant players in the emerging autonomous ride hailing industry, which could be a $14 trillion opportunity by then.\\n\\nArk's projections translate to a Tesla share price of $2,000 in 2027, which represents a whopping 1,010% gain from where it trades today. That's a substantial amount of potential upside for investors who buy the stock now.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 5, 7, 0): ['In the race to create the first fully self-driving (real world) AI, Tesla’s advantage has been the hundreds of thousands of Teslas driving out in the world collecting billions of miles of real-world driving data.\\n\\nThis is as opposed to Waymo, and other self-driving startups, which rely mostly on simulations to train their machine learning models.\\n\\nElon Musk in the past has said, he was surprised to learn Tesla has “better self-driving software and hardware” than Waymo, which is considered by most industry analysts as the leader in self-driving cars.\\n\\nTesla initially released FSD Beta to the 3000 or so individuals in the company’s Early Access Program. However, that number has currently grown to more than 400,000 vehicles, and now the capability comes standard with any purchase of the full-self driving feature in the US and Canada.\\n\\nRelated News: Tesla China Produces 89k Vehicles In March Despite Numerous Challenges\\n\\nNevertheless, despite Tesla’s ample real-world driving footage advantage, the EV maker still relies on simulations to train its AI for edge cases.\\n\\nAnd now Elon Musk says, Tesla autopilot has gotten so good, the EV maker has had to rely more and more on simulations to come up with close call examples to train Tesla’s next iteration of autopilot software.\\n\\nGiven the name FSD version 11, the current iteration of Tesla’s autopilot is a significant architectural rewrite of the Autopilot software especially as it pertains to highway driving.\\n\\nPrior to FSD Beta v11, on highways, Tesla used the pre-FSD Beta iteration of autopilot that doesn’t use all 8 cameras to create a vector space and heavily relies on manually written codes as opposed to AI to make driving decisions.\\n\\nIn addition, following the change with FSD Beta v9 back in the middle of 2022, Tesla has moved away from a hybrid, camera-radar system and is currently using a vision-only machine-learning model.\\n\\nAnd as Tesla’s autopilot AI moves to a pure vision (camera) sensor suite, and away from manually written codes, it stands to reason the more picture-perfect the simulations used to train Tesla’s AI are, the better the system will be.\\n\\nTesla has been improving in this regard and now Elon Musk says “To get enough training examples for potential serious accidents, we have to run them in sim, as we have so few in the fleet, despite doing ~1M miles per day of FSD.”\\n\\nIn response to a Twitter user who pointed out that after the FSD Beta v11 update, he’s convinced that level 5 autonomy is close, Musk also said that the “[autopilot] team is closing the loop on interventions very rapidly.”\\n\\nTeam is closing the loop on interventions very rapidly. To get enough training examples for potential serious accidents, we have to run them in sim, as we have so few in the fleet, despite doing ~1M miles per day of FSD.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 4, 2023\\n\\nMusk’s confidence highlights how close Tesla is to making its vehicles drive themselves. In addition, Musk pointing out the fact there are barely any serious accidents despite FSD Beta doing 1 million miles per day bodes well for the prospect of the software getting the green light from regulators.\\n\\nThis is certainly exciting and we will be sure to keep you posted as Tesla progresses toward level 5 autonomy.

And with Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) currently sitting in seventh place -- at just shy of a $850 billion valuation -- it's likely next in line to be worth $1 trillion.\\n\\nBut can it do so by next year? Or will it take a bit longer for Tesla to cross this threshold? Let's try and find out.\\n\\nTesla has an ultra-premium valuation\\n\\nBack in 2022, Tesla was already a member of the $1 trillion club, garnering its highest valuation of $1.24 trillion early last year. Now, it's looking to rejoin this exclusive group permanently, but there are some caveats.\\n\\nOne of the first items you'll hear about before investing in Tesla is how expensive the stock is. The next-largest car company by valuation is Toyota, worth just over $250 billion, despite having more than triple Tesla's revenue. Even domestic automakers, like Ford Motor and General Motors, have nearly double Tesla's revenue and are only valued at about one-twentieth of Tesla.\\n\\nSo how can this smaller company be valued at such an incredibly high level?\\n\\nIt all boils down to future expectations. Tesla is the leader in electric vehicles (EVs) domestically. Excluding pickup trucks made by the Big Three, the best-selling vehicle in August 2023 was the Toyota RAV4, with the Tesla Model Y in second place. That's an impressive positioning for a car that only comes in electric form.\\n\\nWorldwide, Tesla still is the top dog in pure EV sales (not including hybrids), but Chinese automaker BYD is starting to close the gap. In Q2, Tesla delivered more than 466,000 vehicles (up 86%), while BYD sold 352,000 (up 95%). Still, with Tesla cementing itself as either the top dog or second-largest producer in a field expected to see massive adoption in the coming decade, investors want a piece of the pie.\\n\\nThrow in ancillary businesses like solar panels, energy storage, autonomous driving, and future vehicle launches, and it's no surprise why Tesla is valued the way it is. But is there room for upside?\\n\\nMargins are starting to fall at Tesla\\n\\nOf any chart out there, this is the one that Tesla investors fear most.\\n\\nFrom a price-to-earnings (P/E) perspective, Tesla is a highly valued stock, regardless of whether you classify it as a tech company or an automaker. Furthermore, it's trading near its highs for the year, so investors can't pick up shares for cheap prices. With its forward P/E roughly equal to its trailing P/E, it also conveys that analysts believe Tesla won't grow its earnings over the next year.\\n\\nSo what might be the cause? Shrinking margins. To shore up its EV market share as legacy automakers launch their EV products, Tesla has cut prices on many of its models, which has impacted its gross margin significantly over the past couple of quarters.\\n\\nLower gross margins impact the profit margin because less money makes it to the bottom line. With Tesla's Q2 profit margin falling from 16% to 13%, it hasn't made a drastic impact yet. Plus, with Tesla growing its revenue by 47%, it allowed its earnings per share (EPS) to rise from $0.65 to $0.78.\\n\\nInvestors will be looking for Tesla's margins to stabilize soon. Otherwise, it's on a path to have the same margins as legacy automakers, which would defeat the purpose of Tesla having a premium over its competition.\\n\\nI don't think that will happen, and Tesla will remain on its growth path. With the Cybertruck entering production, it should provide a significant boost for Tesla as it will begin to see a significant return on investment after going through multiple design iterations and buying tooling for the factory.\\n\\nAs a result, I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla stock can rise 19% in the next year to be worth $1 trillion. Tesla has positioned itself well in the world's transition to EVs and should join the trillion-dollar market cap club relatively soon as a result.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 2, 7, 0): ['Tesla is seeking nearly $100 million in U.S. government funding to build nine semi-truck charging stations on a route from the southern border of Texas to the automaker\\'s original factory in Fremont, California, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.\\n\\nThe plan reportedly calls for each site to have eight 750-kw chargers for the Tesla Semi plus four chargers for other makes, essentially following the Megawatt Charging Standard (MCS) for commercial vehicles formalized last summer. The Semi connectors would likely be Tesla\\'s NACS V4 charge connector, which the company has said is good for 1 megawatt.\\n\\nThe plans were discussed in emails from Tesla executives to the Texas Department of Transportation between May and early June, which were examined by Bloomberg. In the emails, Tesla reportedly told Texas officials that the project could qualify for federal grants being distributed under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and asked officials to write a letter in support of the project to be included in Texas\\' funding application, which was submitted in June.\\n\\nTesla Semi (Courtesy of Tesla, Inc.)\\n\\nCalifornia\\'s South Coast Air Quality Management District led the application on behalf of Texas-based Tesla. a representative told Bloomberg the automaker is seeking $97 million of federal funding and plans to pay $24 million itself.\\n\\nBloomberg notes that it is unclear if Tesla will proceed with the truck-charging project if the application is not approved. The Federal Highway Administration, which is charged with overseeing the charging-infrastructure grants, is currently reviewing applications and is expected to name recipients later this year.\\n\\nThe roughly 1,800-mile route begins in Laredo, Texas, which is about 240 miles from Tesla\\'s headquarters in Austin and 150 miles from the site of a new factory the company is building in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Tesla in 2022 was given an exclusive lane at the Mexican border crossing to help move parts from suppliers in Mexico to its U.S. factories in Texas and California, Bloomberg noted. The charging project could electrify at least some of those deliveries, which are currently made with internal-combustion trucks.\\n\\nTesla Semi (Courtesy of Tesla, Inc.)\\n\\nElectric truck stops and charging stations involve far greater challenges for siting because of their impact on the grid, and the need to avoid expensive \"demand charges.\" These are premiums levied by utilities when electricity demand spikes—such as when a number of electric semi trucks are charging at the same time.\\n\\nAs more electric commercial trucks enter service, charging projects are beginning to crop up.

And as the top electric vehicle (EV) company, Tesla is once again attracting a lot of attention.\\n\\nIs the business a worthy addition to your portfolio? Let\\'s dive deeper into the world of Tesla.\\n\\nRecent trends\\n\\nTesla beat Wall Street estimates with its latest financial update, generating revenue of $24.9 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.78. The business also produced 480,000 vehicles during the period, up 86% year over year.\\n\\nHowever, shareholders weren\\'t happy to see that Tesla\\'s gross margin shrunk from 25% in Q2 2022 to 18.2% in the most recent quarter. Management was forced to cut the prices of cars multiple times this year in an effort to boost demand at a time when consumers have been dealing with higher interest rates and inflationary pressures.\\n\\nPricing cuts certainly deserve a lot of the blame for the shrinking operating margin too. However, Tesla\\'s research and development (R&D) expenses of $943 million during the quarter, which were up 41% year over year, hurt profitability as well. The benefit of continuing to spend heavily on R&D, though, is that it can maintain Tesla\\'s lead as a trailblazer in the industry.\\n\\nBigger picture\\n\\nTesla has quickly become a powerful brand in the technology and automotive sectors, known for its innovation, disruption, and forward-thinking designs. Additionally, thanks to the company\\'s massive investments in building up its manufacturing capacity, it\\'s starting to develop a cost advantage when making automobiles. The company is profitable, while a legacy automaker like Ford constantly loses money in its EV division.\\n\\nThese competitive strengths position Tesla to make progress toward Musk\\'s long-term goal, centered on autonomous self-driving. While Tesla does sell cars with its branded full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, they aren\\'t fully autonomous. This means that right now a driver still must pay attention and be ready to intervene and take control if necessary.\\n\\nIf full autonomy is achieved, something Musk believes could happen later this year, it could be a huge financial boon for Tesla. That\\'s because this software, coupled with Tesla\\'s expanding manufacturing capabilities, could turn the company into a provider of robotaxis, which could experience unprecedented demand from consumers and drive outsized revenue and earnings growth over time.\\n\\n\"The short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture,\" Musk said on the Q2 2023 earnings call. \"Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly.\" He has been overly aggressive with his timing deadlines before, so who knows when, or if, this will come to fruition. But it\\'s hard to bet against Elon Musk.\\n\\nApproaching the trillion-dollar mark\\n\\nAs of this writing, Tesla\\'s market cap was just under $800 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. This is obviously indicative of the rapid success of the business, as well as investors\\' appreciation of what Elon Musk has done. However, investors might be right to ask how much more valuable Tesla can really become. Does Tesla deserve a market cap that rivals those of the internet giants, which are some of the most successful businesses ever? I\\'m not sure.\\n\\nTo its credit, Tesla appears to be consistently profitable now, so investors can value the stock based on its earnings. But shares currently trade at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 72. That\\'s not cheap at all, especially when compared to the Nasdaq 100 Index\\'s multiple of 35.\\n\\nInvestors who aren\\'t spooked by the steep valuation or Tesla\\'s huge market cap might still consider buying the stock. If you have confidence that the company can continue its impressive growth in the decade ahead while finding ways to boost profitability, objectives that Musk definitely believes it can hit, then the shares deserve a closer look.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 20, 7, 0): [\"Lately, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -1.76%) has played a key role in determining the direction of the overall market. Yet on Thursday morning, the Nasdaq posted a much more significant decline than other major market benchmarks right after the opening bell. The Nasdaq's move lower of about half a percent stood in contrast to a higher open for the Dow Jones Industrials and a flattish performance for the S&P 500.\\n\\nOne reason the Nasdaq dropped so hard was that shares of both Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) and Netflix (NFLX -1.88%) fell after those companies reported their respective quarterly results. Both had positive things to say about their businesses, but expectations have been high, particularly after the two stocks rose so far in 2023. Below, you'll learn more about what was pushing both stocks lower early Thursday.\\n\\nHas Tesla gotten ahead of itself?\\n\\nShares of Tesla dropped 4% shortly after the open Thursday morning. The electric vehicle maker's second-quarter financial results showed significant sales growth but raised some questions about what future profit margins could look like.\\n\\nTesla stayed in solid growth mode. Revenue of $24.93 billion was up 47% year over year. Adjusted net income was also higher, weighing in at $3.15 billion, but that was only 20% higher than in the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nAs many had anticipated, Tesla's margins fell during the period, but the declines were even sharper than many had expected. Gross margin was down almost 7 percentage points to 18.2%, while operating margin fell nearly 5 percentage points to 9.6%. Tesla's preferred adjusted pre-tax operating profit margin weighed in at 18.7%, down from 22.4% in the year-earlier period. The EV automaker attributed much of the pressure to reduced average sales price for vehicles amid competitive pressures in the industry.\\n\\nEven as shareholders seemed to focus on short-term issues, Tesla kept its eyes squarely on the long-term future. The company touted the coming beginning of production of its Cybertruck EV pickup along with AI enhancements related to self-driving vehicles, and it saw a big jump in its energy storage business. Combined with early signs of revenue from Supercharger sharing arrangements with other automakers, Tesla has a lot of growth drivers that could boost its value over the long run. Yet that doesn't mean its share price can't go down in the short run, particularly after such a huge move higher this year.\\n\\nNetflix falls despite big subscriber count gains\\n\\nShares of Netflix fared even worse, dropping 7% at the open on Thursday. Mixed second-quarter financial results were the culprit, even though the video streaming service provider said several encouraging things.\\n\\nNetflix's financial numbers for the quarter were mixed. Revenue of $8.19 billion was up just 2.7% year over year and fell short of expectations. Net income weighed in at $1.49 billion, higher by 3.3% from year-ago levels, while earnings of $3.29 per share did slightly better than anticipated by most of those following the stock.\\n\\nOn the subscriber front, though, Netflix had solid performance. Net additions of 5.9 million included a gain of 1.17 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, rising from much more sluggish growth figures over the preceding year. International performance perked back up as well, although revenue per subscriber kept trending lower across the network. Most investors attributed the rise in counts to Netflix's crackdown on password sharing.\\n\\nThe big question facing Netflix is the extent to which its ad-supported tier will generate more revenue than it loses because of its lower price point. With the company having eliminated its basic ad-free tier, a rising number of viewers will likely start watching ads -- and that's when that portion of Netflix's business could start to surge.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 24, 7, 0): [\"Towards the end of 2022 and through the first quarter of 2023, the critics were out in full force against Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) and its potentially slowing U.S. demand. In fairness, for about 12 months the electric vehicle (EV) maker had missed sales growth estimates and was slashing prices.\\n\\nBut if you think Tesla is slowing down, think again. Below is a chart along with some figures which show it has regained some momentum recently.\\n\\nBy the numbers\\n\\nWhile we won't see Tesla's official sales in the U.S. until its second-quarter report, recent registrations can serve as a proxy of the momentum Tesla had at the outset of the second quarter.\\n\\nIn April, Tesla's new registrations totaled more than 56,000, which was up from a monthly average of 51,787 in the first three months of the year. For the first four months of the year Tesla's registrations totaled nearly 212,000, which was a 52% gain compared to the prior year. Over the same four months, Tesla's Model Y crossover recorded a 99% increase in new registrations compared to the prior year.\\n\\nOverall, Tesla's market share of new EV registrations increased 50 basis points to 60.8 % in April compared to the first quarter. Here's a look at Tesla's dominance of the top EV models by new-vehicle registrations for the first four months of the year.\\n\\nWhat does this mean?\\n\\nTesla's numbers are solid for April, and gaining momentum, but does that mean the EV maker is poised to top estimates for the second quarter? Unfortunately, these figures don't necessarily mean that, especially since they only offer a glimpse at the first month of the second quarter.\\n\\nBut this does mean that Tesla's momentum for new-vehicle registrations, and likely sales, gained pace in April, and that price cuts were having a positive impact.\\n\\nFurther, Tesla historically has offered some incentives during the last month of each quarter to help boost sales. The company recently marked discounts as high as $7,500 on high-end Model S sedans and Model X crossovers, and free use of its Supercharging network for three years. Tesla is also offering varied discounts on Model 3 if buyers take delivery before June 30th.\\n\\nAs you can see in the chart below, as the concern grew regarding Tesla's slowing demand, the stock tanked toward the end of 2022, before rebounding into April's momentum gain.\\n\\nBottom line\\n\\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said earlier this year that management is willing to sacrifice some profit to boost volume, with its annual global sales growth target at 50%. So far, what we know is that Tesla regained momentum in April and is making a quarter-end sales push.\\n\\nWhile Tesla will likely eventually give up some market share to increasing competition, it appears that the company's price cuts and other incentives are doing exactly what management desired: regain momentum. That's exactly where Tesla wants to be right now.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 3, 7, 0): [\"In the rapidly evolving era of artificial intelligence (AI), businesses increasingly integrate AI into their daily activities to stay relevant and competitive.\\n\\nTesla (TSLA -3.13%), a pioneer in the electric car industry, recognizes the strategic importance of AI in fulfilling its long-term mission. By leveraging AI technologies, Tesla aims to become a smarter, more efficient car manufacturer while venturing into exciting new products like self-driving cars.\\n\\nHere's how Tesla positions itself for success in this AI-driven future.\\n\\nAI will make Tesla a smarter and better car manufacturer\\n\\nIn the age of AI, every company seeks to utilize AI to improve its operations. For Tesla, AI is not just operationally important, but strategically vital in achieving its long-term mission of selling 20 million electric cars.\\n\\nTo realize this ambitious target, Tesla is embarking on a price reduction strategy to expand its market share. By offering cheaper cars, Tesla aims to make its vehicles more affordable for price-sensitive consumers, thus driving sales volume. As Tesla scales up, AI will play a pivotal role in enhancing efficiency, eliminating waste and redundancy, and most importantly, meeting its long-term production targets.\\n\\nAI can significantly aid Tesla's production plans by analyzing vast amounts of data, including historical production records and supply chain information. This allows Tesla to predict the optimal number of cars to produce, determine which factories to utilize, and plan the production schedule accordingly. The result is a more effective production process, ensuring Tesla has enough cars available at the right place and time to meet global customer demands.\\n\\nMoreover, AI proves invaluable during the manufacturing process itself. AI-powered cameras and sensors can thoroughly inspect each car as it moves along the production line, detecting even the tiniest defects that human eyes might miss. Early identification of quality issues enhances product reliability and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nAdditionally, AI-enabled robots and machines excel at handling repetitive tasks like welding, painting, and fixing components with precision and speed, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.\\n\\nThere are many more areas that AI will help Tesla become a better car manufacturer, but you get the idea. With the help of AI, Tesla is bound to do more (and better) with less.\\n\\nAI will help Tesla deliver on its moonshot projects\\n\\nLong-term Tesla fans know that Tesla's ambitions go beyond electric cars, venturing into renewable (and smart) energy, autonomous vehicles, and humanoid robots (Tesla bot).\\n\\nThese ventures share a common thread: the necessity of highly advanced AI.\\n\\nFor example, autonomous driving's success hinges on how well Tesla employs AI as the brain of its self-driving cars. AI enables these vehicles to quickly analyze vast amounts of data, understand and interact with their surroundings, and make safe and intelligent decisions. Although Tesla cars are not yet fully autonomous, the company is leveraging advanced AI to learn from the ever-growing data collected from existing Tesla fleets, leading to continuous improvements in its autonomous driving system.\\n\\nSimilarly, to build useful humanoid robots, Tesla must employ advanced AI to enable them to understand their surroundings, interact with people, and perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. In many ways, these robots need capabilities similar to autonomous cars and potentially more, such as understanding human language, emotions, and behaviors for effective task performance.\\n\\nAI is the key to Tesla's success\\n\\nAs Tesla forges ahead to reshape the automotive and technology landscape, AI will be indispensable to its success.\\n\\nFrom revolutionizing car manufacturing processes to pioneering transformative ventures like autonomous driving and humanoid robots, AI is pivotal in empowering Tesla to innovate and thrive.\\n\\nTesla has already embraced advanced AI technology to create a more sustainable and successful future, and it will likely employ more in the years to come.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 30, 7, 0): ['Sure, investing can feel difficult at times. Market turmoil can give you ulcers. And for most people, spending money is more fun than growing it.\\n\\nNevertheless, regularly investing money in the stock market -- and leaving it there -- is the best way to accumulate wealth.\\n\\nSo, with that in mind, let\\'s take a look at three of my \"forever\" holdings -- stocks I plan on owning for the very long term.\\n\\nAmazon\\n\\nTopping my list of stocks I\\'m never selling is Amazon (AMZN -1.50%). There are multiple reasons why I want to own this e-commerce and cloud giant, but near the top of the list is that Amazon is once again firing on all cylinders.\\n\\nAfter suffering through several frustrating quarters, Amazon investors were recently rewarded with an exceptional quarterly report that blew away expectations.\\n\\nHighlights included:\\n\\nRevenue of $134 billion, up 11% year over year;\\n\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) revenue of $22.1 billion, up 12% year over year;\\n\\nEarnings of $0.65 per share, almost double what Wall Street had expected.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, that peach of a quarter helped put to rest fears that new Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy can\\'t deliver the goods. Jassy\\'s plan to cut costs has paid off, with overall headcount down 4% from a year earlier.\\n\\nDespite those cuts, Amazon continues to develop new and exciting areas for growth while eating away at its competitors\\' market share. Advertising revenue skyrocketed by 22% to $10.7 billion. For comparison, Meta Platform\\'s Facebook saw ad revenue rose 12%, while Alphabet\\'s Google saw only a 3% increase.\\n\\nIn addition, I think Amazon remains extremely well positioned to capitalize on the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. So much so, in fact, that I believe the company could become the second-largest U.S. company by 2030. For all those reasons and more, I\\'m never selling my Amazon shares.\\n\\nAdobe\\n\\nWe all know 2022 was a rough year for the stock market, particularly for tech stocks. In fact, at one point, Adobe (ADBE -1.32%) shares were down by 60% from the all-time high they touched in late 2021.\\n\\nYet, that collapse offers an example of why it\\'s best to buy and hold. This year alone, shares are up 60%. Even so, I\\'m not planning on selling my shares anytime soon.\\n\\nAdobe\\'s business model, centered around its Creative Cloud software bundle, is set up to thrive for years. Graphic designers, content creators, photographers, teachers, students, and more all rely on Adobe\\'s products to make eye-catching content.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, Adobe is leading the way in showing how human creativity can be supercharged by AI. The company is integrating many AI-powered features into its popular software titles such as Adobe Photoshop, Firefly, and Premier Pro.\\n\\nFinancially, the results are clear. Adobe generated $18.4 billion in revenue over the last 12 months. Revenue for the fiscal quarter that ended on June 2 was up 10% year over year. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Adobe to grow sales 12% in 2024.\\n\\nWith those sound financials backing up its best-in-class software, I plan on holding Adobe for a very long time.\\n\\nTesla\\n\\nRounding out my list is Tesla (TSLA -3.13%). I plan on holding shares of Tesla forever. That\\'s because it -- even more than my other two picks -- is a bet on the distant future.\\n\\nAnd that shouldn\\'t come as a surprise, given how Tesla -- and its mercurial leader, Elon Musk -- view the company\\'s mission. Tesla\\'s mission statement is \"to accelerate the world\\'s transition to sustainable energy.\"\\n\\nObviously, building and selling enormous numbers of electric vehicles (EVs) is one key to fulfilling that mission, but Tesla\\'s plans don\\'t end there. In the future, Tesla plans on becoming a far more substantial player in the energy economy.\\n\\nConsider this: Currently, Tesla\\'s energy segment currently generates a modest 7% of the company\\'s revenue. However, its energy generation and storage business is booming, with sales increasing 74% year over year.\\n\\nIntuitively, this makes sense. Environmentally conscious consumers who buy new EVs will want to charge them in a sustainable fashion. That will drive up demand for Tesla\\'s clean energy and storage solutions. And since some analysts believe Tesla already has the world\\'s best battery technology, the company should have a significant head start in the race to supply the batteries that will power residential homes and EVs.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s an excellent reason to own Tesla -- now and forever.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 2, 7, 0): ['Move over Bernard Arnault: Elon Musk is once again the richest person in the world. The CEO of Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) previously held the title for the world\\'s richest person. But in December, he was surpassed by Arnault.\\n\\nArnault\\'s time at the top proved short-lived, with Musk reclaiming his crown on May 31.\\n\\nSome may be wondering what Arnault did earlier this year to jump past Musk. And some may also be wondering what Musk did now to reclaim the top spot. Well, you might be shocked to find out they both did the same thing: nothing.\\n\\nI\\'ll explain.\\n\\nThe back-and-forth between Arnault and Musk\\n\\nThe majority of Bernard Arnault\\'s wealth comes from his personal stake in luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY -1.76%), or simply LVMH. Arnault owns about half of LVMH both directly and indirectly and is also its CEO.\\n\\nLikewise, Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla. And he\\'s also the founder and CEO of SpaceX. Through his large ownership stakes in both companies, Musk has become a centi-billionaire.\\n\\nSpaceX is a private company. Therefore, its value changes less frequently than that of a public company. By contrast, stock prices change every day that the stock market is open. And in May, shares of LVMH and Tesla headed in completely opposite directions, as the chart below shows.\\n\\nThis is how Musk just pulled ahead of Arnault once again.\\n\\nIt was a different story for LVMH and Tesla, however, in 2021 and 2022. Elon Musk watched his net worth drop as the value of Tesla stock drifted downwards. But the luxury-goods market was strong during this time, and LVMH stock gained. This had allowed Arnault to overtake Musk.\\n\\nTherefore, all Arnault and Musk did was hold the shares of their companies. This is what I mean when I say they did nothing.\\n\\nAccording to The Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Musk\\'s net worth is estimated at $192 billion as of May 31, up $55 billion so far year to date. For his part, Arnault\\'s net worth is up year to date as well and sits at $187 billion.\\n\\nHow many shares of Tesla does Musk have?\\n\\nAccording to a March filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Elon Musk beneficially owns just over 715 million shares of Tesla stock. At its current price of about $208 per share, that\\'s worth nearly $150 billion, accounting for somewhere in the neighborhood of three-quarters of his net worth.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth pointing out that Musk owns about 411 million shares of Tesla in the Elon Musk Revocable Trust. The rest of his position is related to stock options.\\n\\nThe lesson for investors\\n\\nOwning shares of companies that grow and create shareholder value is a fantastic way to create wealth -- both Arnault and Musk owe a lot to the stock market. However, stock prices can be volatile. And investors can see big swings in the value of their investments. Consequently, Musk and Arnault are trading places at the top of the list of the world\\'s richest people. They\\'ll probably switch places again at some point.\\n\\nThe value of stocks can go down. In fact, Arnault \"lost\" $11 billion in a single day recently. This experience can be painful for any investor regardless of net worth or investing experience. And unfortunately, many investors sell at the worst possible time simply because they want the pain to stop.\\n\\nSelling a stock just because it\\'s down can lead to terrible long-term results. Stocks can go down for any number of emotional reasons in the short term. But longer term, stock prices tend to follow business results. Therefore, as long as business fundamentals remain strong, it\\'s in investors\\' best interests to just sit back and do nothing.\\n\\nAs we can see with Tesla and LVMH, business is good. Revenue is up for both companies over the last few years, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) are sharply higher for both as well.\\n\\nIn short, Musk and Arnault have made the right choice to simply hold on to their large positions in Tesla and LVMH, respectively, even though shares have pulled back at times.\\n\\nIt\\'s a great lesson for all investors. When you\\'ve found a top stock to invest in, buy and hold through the ups and downs. The strategy will yield far greater results than selling every time you\\'re down on your investment.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 20, 7, 0): ['Has Cathie Wood lost her love for Tesla (TSLA -3.13%)? At first glance, you might think that\\'s the case. Two of her Ark Invest exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sold shares of Tesla last month.\\n\\nHowever, those sales merely reflected minor rebalancing moves and didn\\'t involve a significant block of shares. The reality is that Wood remains as big of a Tesla fan as ever.\\n\\nShe appeared on CNBC\\'s Fast Money program on Sept. 18 and talked about her views on Tesla. Wood predicted that Tesla stock will skyrocket to $1,400 or more by 2027. Here\\'s why she could be right.\\n\\nWood\\'s bear case for Tesla\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that Wood\\'s $1,400 price target for Tesla is her bear case for the stock. She thinks it\\'s likely that Tesla\\'s share price will rise significantly higher than that over the next four years.\\n\\nWood does foresee strong sales growth for Tesla\\'s electric vehicles (EVs). However, she told CNBC\\'s Melissa Lee earlier this week that EVs make up only around one-third of Ark Invest\\'s projected valuation for Tesla. The other two-thirds of Ark\\'s valuation is related to autonomous vehicles. In particular, Wood believes that Tesla has a massive opportunity in autonomous ride-hailing, sometimes referred to as robotaxis.\\n\\nArk Invest detailed in a report released in April 2023 that Tesla could generate annual net revenue in the ballpark of $200 billion by 2027 from autonomous ride-hailing. Again, that\\'s the bear case.\\n\\nNo, Tesla doesn\\'t have a robotaxi service right now. However, Ark expects the company to launch one relatively soon, with 2024 as the most likely timing.\\n\\nWhy Wood could be right about Tesla\\n\\nThere are several factors that could prove Wood\\'s prediction wrong. Competition especially stands out, considering that a few of Tesla\\'s rivals already have robotaxi services in selected U.S. markets. But Wood could also be right about Tesla stock soaring more than 5x by 2027.\\n\\nShe stated in the CNBC interview on Monday, \"Tesla is in the pole position here in the United States.\" Wood argued that Tesla has a major advantage because it has more data than all the other autonomous vehicle companies combined. The Ark Invest leader doesn\\'t look for Tesla to command a robotaxi monopoly because of its edge. However, she thinks that autonomous ride-hailing will be \"a winner-take-most market.\" And that winner, in her view, will be Tesla.\\n\\nIn particular, Wood believes that safety will be a key factor behind Tesla\\'s success. She noted that auto deaths are rising in the U.S. Texting while driving is an especially big issue. Human error ranks as the top cause, by far, in motor vehicle accidents.\\n\\nWood thinks that shifting to vehicles driven by artificial intelligence can help address these problems, saying, \"People driving in Tesla cars are 40%-plus safer with Autopilot and FSD [full self-driving capability] than in other cars.\" Ark Invest reported in April that its research found that \"Tesla\\'s FSD is 5x safer than a manually driven Tesla\" adjusting for use on regular city streets only.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Ark\\'s bull case for Tesla?\\n\\nIf a return of more than 5x by 2027 is Wood\\'s bear case for Tesla, what is her bull case for the stock? Ark Invest thinks that Tesla\\'s share price could skyrocket nearly 9.5x to $2,500 over the next four years. In this bull model, Tesla\\'s robotaxi revenue could grow to more than $600 billion by 2027.\\n\\nThere\\'s one significant fly in the ointment with Wood\\'s full-blown bullish outlook for Tesla, though: It depends on the company rolling out its robotaxi service in the fourth quarter of 2023. That timing appears to be highly unlikely.\\n\\nTesla CEO Elon Musk did say in the company\\'s second-quarter conference call that he expects the FSD technology will \"be better than humans by the end of this year.\" But he acknowledged that Tesla hasn\\'t won U.S. regulatory approval yet. Musk also admitted: \"I\\'ve been wrong in the past. I may be wrong this time.\"\\n\\nMany might argue that Wood\\'s bear case price target for Tesla is also unrealistic. However, if her assumptions about the robotaxi market -- and Tesla\\'s advantages in that market -- prove to be correct, so will her prediction about the stock.\\n\\nThere\\'s one thing we know for sure: With Tesla ranking by far as the top holding for Ark Invest, Wood is putting her money (and Ark investors\\' money) where her mouth is.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 12, 8, 0): [],\n datetime.datetime(2022, 12, 22, 8, 0): [],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 19, 7, 0): ['Cathie Wood is the founder and CEO of Ark Invest, an asset management company focused on disruptive innovation. Wood became a sensation during the early days of the pandemic as her bold investment strategy led to incredible outperformance. The Ark Innovation ETF soared 148% in 2020, crushing the 16% return of the broader S&P 500.\\n\\nAll of those gains have since disappeared, but Wood remains confident in many of the same companies, especially Tesla (TSLA -3.13%). Ark recently published a valuation model that prices Tesla at $2,000 per share by 2027, which implies 1,030% upside from its current price.\\n\\nThat valuation model hinges on robotaxis, a topic that Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently discussed in an interview with CNBC. He said that full self-driving (FSD) technology would ultimately allow Tesla to sell cars for software margins and that Ark Invest has the \"best analysis\" he\\'s seen on the topic.\\n\\nHere\\'s what investors should know.\\n\\nTesla plans to build a robotaxi by 2024\\n\\nTesla commands an extraordinary valuation compared to its peers. With a market cap of nearly $570 billion, Tesla is worth as much as the next five automakers combined. But the company is also running circles around many of its peers where battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and self-driving cars are concerned.\\n\\nTesla led the BEV market last year, and it\\'s market share has actually increased during the first three months of 2023. The company accounted for almost 24% of BEV sales in March, while the next closest competitor held about 15% market share. More impressive yet, Tesla reported the highest operating margin among volume carmakers last year. Musk attributes that success to manufacturing expertise. In fact, he says Tesla has the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world.\\n\\nGoing forward, management believes it can maintain its industry-leading margins, and one reason for that confidence is FSD software, which can be sold at nearly 100% gross margin. Management expects FSD technology to be the most important source of profitability in the future. During the CNBC interview, Musk said it would allow Tesla to make \"two or three times the original value, or sale value of the car, in robotaxi revenue.\"\\n\\nOn that front, Tesla is well positioned to be a leader in autonomous vehicles. The company has far more autopilot-enabled cars on the road compared to its peers, which means Tesla has far more training data for the artificial intelligence algorithms that power its FSD software. Musk also believes its cars are equipped with the most efficient inference computer (i.e., the supercomputer that runs the FSD software) in the world. In short, Tesla has more data and it may have better technology, and it plans to capitalize on that advantage by mass producing a robotaxi in 2024.\\n\\nSo what? After building a fleet of robotaxis, the next step for Tesla will be launching an autonomous riding-hailing network, and that will significantly increase its addressable market. Ark Invest believes autonomous ride-hailing platforms will generate $4 trillion in revenue by 2027 and $9 trillion in revenue by 2030.\\n\\nArk\\'s valuation model for Tesla\\n\\nArk outlines three scenarios in its 2027 valuation model. A bear case that values Tesla at $1,400 per share, a bull case that values Tesla at $2,500 per share, and an intermediate case that values Tesla at $2,000 per share. The intermediate scenario assumes Tesla will generate $1.02 trillion in revenue by 2027, and that 44% of that revenue (or $449 billion) will come from robotaxis.\\n\\nFor context, Ark\\'s valuation model implies annualized revenue growth of 68% through 2027, which represents a material acceleration from annualized revenue growth of 49% over the last three years. I find that forecast wildly optimistic, and I say that as a Tesla shareholder, so it stands to reason that some investors will find Ark\\'s valuation model to be utter nonsense.\\n\\nHere is the bottom line: Cathie Wood is clearly very bullish on the disruptive potential of robotaxis, and she has made prescient calls on Tesla stock in the past. It\\'s also noteworthy that Elon Musk says Ark\\'s valuation model is the best analysis he\\'s seen. Of course, Musk has been overly optimistic at times -- he predicted that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road in 2020 -- but under his watch, Tesla has still become a leader in the BEV space with industry-leading margins. To that end, investors shouldn\\'t be surprised if Tesla also finds its way to the top of the robotaxi market in the future.',\n  \"Owning shares of Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) can be a roller-coaster ride, and the last 12 months have been no exception. Tesla shares plummeted in 2022, but this year, they've come roaring back to life and are up 39% year to date.\\n\\nSo, given the current uncertainties in the electric vehicle (EV) market -- and the stock market overall -- is now the right time to load up on shares of the EV giant? Let's take a closer look.\\n\\nThe bear case: Lower prices, lower margins\\n\\nThe bear case for Tesla focuses on two declining figures: the price Tesla charges to purchase a vehicle, and its profit on each sale. This year, both figures have decreased.\\n\\nFor example, the purchase price for a Tesla Model S Long Range has dropped from $106,190 to $91,380. The company's cheapest vehicle, the Tesla Model 3, is now available for $41,880 -- down from $48,190 in 2022. That makes the Model 3 cheaper than the average new car sold in the U.S.\\n\\nAnd while this is all great news for consumers looking to purchase a new, affordable electric vehicle (EV), it's not necessarily great news for Tesla shareholders. That's because those reduced prices drive down profit margins for Tesla.\\n\\nIndeed, Tesla's operating margin has decreased from 19% in early 2022 to 11% as of its most recent quarter. Similarly, gross margins have dropped from 29% to 19%.\\n\\nThis demonstrates that the battle to dominate the EV market will be a costly one for Tesla, and it gives Tesla bears a strong argument that demand for the company's EVs is decelerating.\\n\\nThe bull case: More production, more pathways to profit\\n\\nThere are, however, reasons for investors to be optimistic about Tesla, despite the concerns over its margins.\\n\\nFirst, the automobile industry is undergoing a sea change. The internal combustion engine is on the way out, and EVs are coming -- lots of them.\\n\\nTesla has the early lead in the race to meet the world's demand for EVs. And it's an enormous lead. In the first quarter of 2023, Tesla produced and sold over 400,000 EVs. For comparison, General Motors sold slightly more than 20,000; Ford managed less than 11,000.\\n\\nBut Tesla's EV leadership goes beyond just production figures. Recently, Elon Musk reiterated that Full-Self-Driving (FSD) will be a game-changer for Tesla. Musk predicted that the release of FSD software might lead to a 'ChatGPT' moment for Tesla, and that FSD might only be a year away.\\n\\nGranted, Musk and Tesla have been too optimistic on their FSD predictions in the past. Nevertheless, with millions of Teslas already on the road, the possibilities that could be unlocked with FSD are massive. Even if only a fraction of those vehicles are put into service as robotaxis or delivery vehicles, they could still disrupt numerous industries that rely on human drivers.\\n\\nIs Tesla a buy?\\n\\nTesla is facing headwinds from its shrinking margins. However, the company continues to ramp up production, while still innovating. For investors willing to ride along for the long haul, I think Tesla will see its margins -- and stock -- soar higher in the years to come.\",\n  'It\\'s no surprise that electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly replacing conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, with governments across the world prioritizing the reduction of emissions to control global warming. The U.S. government is aiming for EVs to account for half of all vehicle sales by 2030, while Europe is targeting 100% EV sales by 2035. China, the largest EV market in the world, is also gearing up to impose more stringent vehicle emissions regulations starting July 1 -- implying a more favorable environment for EV sales.\\n\\nSo there is huge growth potential for EV companies, especially well-established players such as Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) and BYD Company (BYDDY 1.82%). While Tesla has been the undisputed EV leader for several years, BYD surpassed the company in deliveries in the first half of fiscal 2022. Both companies are in a race to reduce the prices of electric cars, thereby boosting deliveries. But which of the two will make the better investment?\\n\\nLet\\'s find out.\\n\\nTesla is betting big on the success of fully self-driving technology\\n\\nDespite gaining nearly 42% so far this year, shares of Tesla remain down by 31% on a year-over-year basis. Tesla\\'s aggressive pricing strategy (six cuts in the last year) has not only affected the company\\'s margins but also overall investor sentiment for the automotive giant. However, since Tesla is now prioritizing sales volumes over profitability in the current difficult macroeconomic environment, the company expects its deliveries to reach 2 million in 2023, up from 1.3 million in 2022.\\n\\nTesla clocked in revenue of $23.3 billion and free cash flow of $441 million in the first quarter (ending March 31, 2023). The company also reported gross margin and operating margin of 19.3% and 11.4%, respectively. With Tesla being one of the few profitable EV players in the world, CEO Elon Musk believes it is positioned to sell its cars at zero profit and still reap huge financial rewards from the sale of its autonomous driving technology.\\n\\nTesla charges an extra $15,000 for access to its fully self-driving (FSD) software package, the advanced version of its driver assistance software. However, customers can also opt for FSD services without a long-term commitment by paying a subscription fee of $199 per month. Tesla vehicles using FSD beta software reported one collision per 3.2 million miles driven, far better than the one collision per 500,000 miles driven by an average car in the U.S. If FSD becomes more mainstream, the company is set to reap huge financial rewards from the robotaxi market (estimated to grow from $1 billion in 2023 to $38.6 billion in 2030).\\n\\nBYD is a Charlie Munger favorite\\n\\nWarren Buffett\\'s right-hand man, Charlie Munger, considers China-based BYD as solid competition for Tesla and \"one of the best investments of his career.\" The third-largest battery manufacturer in the world, BYD has also become China\\'s best-selling car brand, even ahead of Volkswagen (the leading auto brand in China for the past 15 years).\\n\\nBYD\\'s prominence in China is also seen as a major challenge to Tesla\\'s market share. Besides the home market, the company is focusing on opportunities in international markets such as Latin America, Japan, and Europe.\\n\\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, the company is planning to invest an additional $1.2 billion to expand the manufacturing of its lithium iron phosphate Blade batteries at a new factory in Zhengzhou. Local media has also reported BYD\\'s plans to mass-produce cheaper sodium-ion batteries by the second quarter of 2023 and use them in EV models such as Qin EV, Dolphin, and Seagull. Already a dominant player in the affordable EV segment, BYD will continue to drive its sales momentum and overall growth with these battery innovations.\\n\\nRegulatory risks play a role\\n\\nTesla is currently trading at 51 times earnings, while BYD is trading at 30 times earnings. Both companies are trading at a significant premium to the average P/E multiple of the automotive industry, which is 11.2. However, the premium is justified considering that the two companies are leading the EV revolution.\\n\\nTesla outpaces BYD in profit margins -- a key determinant for investment potential. Further, while there is much potential for BYD to grow in its home market, investments in China-based companies are fraught with regulatory risks. Investors in the U.S. may find it difficult to reconcile the differences in accounting and auditing standards and may not be comfortable with government interference in public-listed companies in China.\\n\\nHence, although BYD is an exciting company, it may make more sense for investors to opt for Tesla shares now.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 22, 7, 0): [\"There aren't too many company-specific events that draw the attention of everyday and professional investors quite like electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla's (TSLA -3.13%) annual shareholder meeting. Getting to hear CEO Elon Musk discuss Tesla's progress and what innovations can shape the future is the type of stuff that excites Wall Street and growth-seeking investors.\\n\\nThe reason Musk and his company are given so much credence on Wall Street is because Tesla has been able to do something that no other automaker has done in more than a half-century: successfully build itself from the ground up to mass production. Although this production ramp has cost a pretty penny, Tesla looks to be on track to produce 1.8 million EVs in 2023.\\n\\nFurthermore, Tesla has been profitable, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), in each of the past three years. Meanwhile, the EV divisions of virtually every new and legacy automaker are deeply in the red.\\n\\nElon Musk puts a huge rumor to bed\\n\\nWhile Tesla's annual meeting gave existing shareholders plenty to look forward to, such as the start of production on the Cybertruck later this year, as well as the announcement that Tesla intends to produce a new drive unit that'll require less silicon carbide, it's what Musk said during the question-and-answer session that might have left shareholders less-than-pleased.\\n\\nA member of the audience asked Tesla's chief the following:\\n\\nEarlier this year, you cut prices on everything 15%-20%. More recently, you've been raising prices on Model Y, Model S, and Model X. Could you just talk about the pricing strategy on Model Y going forward -- keep it separate from the decision to bring out the next-gen vehicles that we all agree is going to blow the doors off on volume. But just on Model Y, it's the best-selling product in the world, can you just talk about the strategy of pricing going forward on that?\\n\\nMusk's response to this question was lengthy and described how Tesla's pricing strategy differs from traditional automakers. In particular, he emphasized how Tesla doesn't use intermediaries to sell its vehicles, which makes its pricing strategy more transparent than vehicles you'd see on dealership lots.\\n\\nBut it was the initial response to this audience members' question that may not sit well with shareholders. Said Musk,\\n\\nI mean it's pretty straightforward. I mean, we see what the demand is, and then we adjust pricing to meet the demand.\\n\\nThe speculation among optimists had been that Tesla was reducing prices in the U.S., Asia, and Europe to account for its improved production efficiencies and to steal share from its competition. One of the core Tesla investment theses is that scaling output, refining the production process, and continuing to innovate, will drive the per-cost vehicle down and make its EVs affordable for consumers around the world.\\n\\nHowever, Musk's comments put this rumor to bed. He very clearly and directly states that Tesla's half-dozen price cuts in the U.S. since the beginning of the year are tied to demand. If prices are coming down, it's a signal that demand for Tesla's EVs isn't as strong as expected.\\n\\nFurthermore, inventory levels for Tesla have been rising throughout the year. Four weeks ago, InsideEvs.com noted that Tesla's new U.S. inventory hit an all-time high. That's not good news after slashing prices a cumulative 15% to 20% in four months.\\n\\nPricing is just one potential concern for Tesla's shareholders\\n\\nBut as I've pointed out recently, pricing concerns represent just one of the many challenges facing Tesla. Although the company is profitable and well-capitalized, it's set to face a mountain of headwinds in the coming quarters.\\n\\nOne of the biggest potential concerns for Tesla is the growing expectation that an economic downturn will take shape. Multiple indicators and metrics have suggested that a U.S. recession is likely. Meanwhile, the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's March meeting show the central bank has modeled a mild recession into its outlook for later this year.\\n\\nThe auto industry is highly cyclical, which means it thrives when the U.S. economy is expanding and struggles when economic activity contracts. If Tesla is already seeing its new-vehicle inventory climb to record levels in the U.S. prior to a recession, it's worrisome to think what might happen to pricing and automotive gross margin if a U.S. recession does materialize in the second-half of 2023.\\n\\nTo further flesh out this point, Tesla has been commanding a premium price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for years. As of this past week, investors were paying close to 50 times forecast earnings in 2023.\\n\\nWhile this is a P/E ratio that could make sense for a supercharged growth stock that isn't highly cyclical, it makes absolutely no sense for an auto stock. Not only do auto stocks typically trade at single-digit P/E ratios, but all of Tesla's attempts to generate profits outside of selling and leasing EVs have thus far failed. As nothing more than an auto company, a P/E of 50 during a possible economic downturn can't be justified.\\n\\nHowever, I've long felt the biggest risk for Tesla continues to be Elon Musk. Despite being a visionary, Musk brings legal and operating liabilities to the table that are more distraction than help for his company. In August 2022, I discussed some of the ways Tesla's chief has drawn the ire of securities regulators.\\n\\nWhat's more, Musk has promised a vast sea of new innovations and technologies, many of which are baked into Tesla's valuation. The problem is that many of these innovations and technologies are eventually delayed or get scrapped altogether. Examples include fully autonomous driving (i.e., Level 5 full self-driving) being pushed back year after year, as well as Musk failing to put 1 million autonomous robotaxis on our roads, as was promised years ago.\\n\\nTesla has an extensive track record of proving pessimists wrong. But with clear-cut evidence of waning demand vis-à-vis Musk's comments on Tesla's pricing activity, the bears may be sitting pretty.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 9, 22, 7, 0): ['Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) is one of the world\\'s most well-known and popular companies. A big driver of its popularity is the presence of charismatic and controversial co-founder and CEO Elon Musk. The visionary Musk, who also leads SpaceX and Twitter, among other companies, created Tesla with one ambitious goal: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass-market electric cars to market as soon as possible.\\n\\nImage source: Tesla\\n\\nMusk has certainly succeeded with that mission. Tesla produced almost 1.4 million electric vehicles (EVs) in 2022, including about 1.3 million Model 3 cars designed for the mass market. In addition to producing EVs, Tesla develops, manufactures, and installs solar energy systems (Solar City), battery storage systems (Powerwall), and EV charging infrastructure (Superchargers). It has also developed other technologies, including autopilot and self-driving features. The company is as ambitious as ever. Tesla unveiled its Master Plan 3 at its Investor Day in early 2023. The company aims to help lead the planet to sustainability. A key aspect of that strategy is to ramp up its production to 20 million EVs annually by 2030. The company plans to build more gigafactories to manufacture its EVs, battery storage systems, and other sustainable energy products.\\n\\nThese investments should help drive the company\\'s revenue and profits, giving the stock the power to soar and making Tesla a compelling stock for investors to buy.

Once you complete the order page, click the \"Place Order\" button at the bottom and become a Tesla shareholder.\\n\\nShould I invest? Should I invest in Tesla? Before buying shares in Tesla, you need to decide whether you should invest in Tesla stock. Here are some reasons to consider investing in Tesla: You want to invest in a company driven to accelerate the adoption of sustainable energy.\\n\\nYou understand the risks of investing in Tesla, including the possibility that shares could lose value.\\n\\nYou\\'ve thoroughly researched Tesla and understand how it makes money.\\n\\nYou believe Tesla\\'s strategy will increase its revenue and earnings at an above-average rate over the long term.\\n\\nYou want to invest directly in stocks and have the time to follow the company.\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to earn dividend income.\\n\\nYou are confident that Elon Musk can lead Tesla and handle all his other responsibilities.\\n\\nYou plan to hold shares for the long term and ride out any near-term volatility.\\n\\nYou think that more auto companies will follow Ford ( F -1.65% GM ( GM -1.59% Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) in adopting Tesla\\'s supercharging network, becoming a growth driver for the company.\\n\\nConversely, here are some reasons an investor might choose not to buy shares of Tesla: You need the money you plan to invest in Tesla stock to cover emergencies or for a major planned purchase within the next three to five years.\\n\\nYou\\'re concerned about the company\\'s valuation.\\n\\nYou\\'re worried about the economy, your job, health issues within your family, or other pressing matters.\\n\\nYou have yet to research Tesla and need to know what it does and how it makes money.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have the time to invest directly in stocks and follow Tesla.\\n\\nYou\\'re near retirement and need dividend income.\\n\\nYou\\'re concerned about the risk that shares could lose value.\\n\\nElon Musk\\'s values don\\'t align with yours.\\n\\nYou don\\'t think other automakers\\' growing adoption of Tesla\\'s supercharger network will be a profit driver.\\n\\nIs Tesla profitable? Is Tesla profitable? Earnings growth is one of the key drivers of a company\\'s stock price over the long term. After years of posting losses, Tesla finally turned the corner on profitability in 2020. The company\\'s profits have surged over the last two years. They more than doubled in 2022, reaching a record $12.6 billion.\\n\\nImage source: Statista.\\n\\nTesla is also free-cash-flow positive. The company produced $14.7 billion of operating cash flow in 2022 and $7.6 billion of free cash flow. That helped grow the company\\'s cash and investments balance to $22.2 billion against only about $3.1 billion of debt and finance leases, putting Tesla in a strong financial position. Tesla\\'s rapidly rising profits should help power its stock over the long term. If the company can continue growing earnings at an above-average rate, the share price should gain value in the coming years. However, shares could crash in value if Tesla hits an earnings growth speed bump. Does Tesla pay a dividend? Does Tesla pay a dividend? As of mid-2023, Tesla does not make dividend payments to its shareholders. The company retains 100% of its earnings and cash flow to reinvest in growing the business and its cash balance. Tesla is investing heavily to build additional gigafactories and expand its production capacity. In 2023, it unveiled an additional $3.6 billion investment to continue the expansion of Gigafactory Nevada. The company also plans to invest more than $5 billion in building a new gigafactory in Mexico. Given the company\\'s continued heavy investments in expansion, it likely won\\'t start paying dividends anytime soon. It\\'s not an ideal stock for those who need to earn passive income for retirement.\\n\\nETF options ETFs with exposure to Tesla Instead of actively buying shares directly, you can passively invest in Tesla by investing in a fund holding its stock. Tesla is one of the largest publicly traded companies by market capitalization and is a widely held stock. Tesla is in several stock market indexes, including the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index. As a result, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that benchmark their returns against those indexes hold Tesla stock. According to ETF.com, 329 ETFs held a reported 227.5 million shares of Tesla as of mid-2023. The five biggest ETFs holding Tesla shares are:\\n\\nData source: ETF.com.

However, several smaller ETFs have a greater weighting to Tesla. Among the most notable are the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY -1.56%) and Cathie Wood\\'s ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK -1.31%). The Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR ETF, which has $17.4 billion of assets under management, has a 21% weighting to Tesla. Meanwhile, the ARK Innovation ETF has $8.1 billion in assets under management and a 12% weighting to Tesla. Given their higher weightings, the ETFs are potential options for investors who want higher exposure to Tesla stock without directly owning shares.\\n\\nDefinition Icon Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, allows investors to buy many stocks or bonds at once.\\n\\nWill Tesla stock split? Will Tesla stock split? As of mid-2023, Tesla did not have an upcoming stock split. However, the company has completed two stock splits in its history as a public company:\\n\\nData source: Tesla and The Motley Fool. Type of Stock Split Date Pre-Split Price 5-for-1 August 2020 Around $2,200 per share 3-for-1 August 2022 Around $900 per share\\n\\nEach time the company split its stock, the share price decreased to a more accessible level for individual investors. The most recent split reduced the share price to about $300. As of mid-2023, Tesla stock was still around that post-split level. It seems unlikely that Tesla will split its stock anytime soon. Given the historical trend, Tesla will likely wait until shares are closer to $1,000 before announcing another split.\\n\\nRelated investing topics\\n\\nThe bottom line on investing in Tesla stock Tesla is one of the most innovative companies in the world.

Even after a pullback that\\'s seen Tesla stock lose close to two-thirds of its value, shares are up nearly 5,900% in a decade.\\n\\nThis monumental return is a reflection of Tesla doing something that hadn\\'t been done in more than a half-century -- namely, an automaker was successfully built from the ground up to mass production. Last year, Tesla produced nearly 1.37 million EVs and delivered a little over 1.31 million EVs (mostly Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs).\\n\\nAnother reason Tesla became the largest automaker in the world by market cap is its push to recurring profitability. Tesla has been profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the past two years and no longer needs to rely on renewable energy credits to push itself over the hump to recurring profitability.\\n\\nBut despite Tesla\\'s outperformance since going public, it\\'s a stock that I wouldn\\'t buy with free money. While recognizing that it\\'s North America\\'s leading EV manufacturer, I wouldn\\'t touch Tesla stock with a 10-foot pole for the following seven reasons.\\n\\n1. Tesla isn\\'t immune to cyclical headwinds\\n\\nTo begin with, investors should recognize that Tesla is a cyclical company that isn\\'t immune to the headwinds impacting the auto industry -- even if its share price has seemingly ignored this fact.\\n\\nAutomakers have been contending with semiconductor supply shortages, parts shortages tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, and historically high inflation. The latter has forced auto manufacturers to make a difficult choice: eat higher material costs or risk reducing buying demand by increasing prices.\\n\\nThe point is that Tesla is dealing with production headwinds right alongside legacy auto companies and doesn\\'t possess any inherent advantages as it tackles the growing likelihood of the U.S. falling into recession in 2023.\\n\\n2. It lacks true branding power\\n\\nAlthough there\\'s no question Tesla has found a way to resonate with EV buyers -- otherwise, it wouldn\\'t have delivered 1.31 million EVs in 2022 -- it doesn\\'t yet possess the branding power to connect with and engage consumers like legacy automakers. Tesla was, after all, founded just 20 years ago.\\n\\nBy comparison, Detroit legends, like General Motors and Ford Motor Company, have more than a century of history at their disposal. The long list of vehicles manufactured by GM and Ford can ignite memories from multiple generations of Americans and is an intangible factor that Tesla can\\'t compete against.\\n\\nI\\'d also add to this point that Tesla\\'s lack of history and branding power makes its recent approval decline among consumers worrisome. According to U.K.-based research company YouGov, Tesla\\'s approval rating fell from a net-positive score of 5.9% at the beginning of 2022 to negative 1.4% by early November. Likewise, a poll from Morning Consult found that America\\'s opinion of Tesla as a company shifted from 43% positive and 15% negative at the beginning of 2022 to 38% positive and 22% negative by late November.\\n\\n3. It really is just a car company\\n\\nThe third reason I wouldn\\'t put a dime to work in Tesla stock is because it truly is nothing more than a car company.\\n\\nTesla optimists love to point out that it has an energy business responsible for installing battery packs in homes and solar panels on roofs. The company also operates various services, including its supercharger network. But dig into Tesla\\'s quarterly filings -- the actual 10Qs and not just the brief overview provided on Tesla\\'s investor relations page -- and you\\'ll see where Tesla generates its GAAP profit.\\n\\nThrough the first nine months of 2022, Tesla generated 98.4% of its $15.08 billion in gross profit from automotive revenue (sales, regulatory credits, and leasing). Just $244 million in gross profit was generated on close to $7 billion in energy, storage, and services revenue.\\n\\nThese are low-margin, money-losing businesses once operating expenses are factored in. Tesla really is just a car company.\\n\\n4. Tesla\\'s first-mover advantages aren\\'t sustainable\\n\\nAnother reason I want nothing to do with Tesla stock is the expectation that its first-mover advantages won\\'t be sustainable.\\n\\nFor instance, General Motors and Ford are earmarking respective $35 billion and $50 billion for EV, battery, and autonomous-vehicle research. GM and Ford each anticipate launching 30 new models worldwide by the end of 2025 and have seen strong preorders for their high-margin trucks.\\n\\nLooking overseas, BYD (BYDD.F 0.76%) (BYDDY 1.82%) trounced Tesla in 2022 by selling 1.9 million combined EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In particular, BYD\\'s alternative-energy vehicle sales ramp up has been much faster than Tesla in China, the world\\'s No. 1 auto market.\\n\\nEven new players are beginning to run circles around Tesla. The ET7 and ET5 sedans launched by Nio (NIO 0.40%) in March 2022 and September 2022, respectively, have a 621-mile range with the top battery-pack upgrade. That\\'s nearly double the range of a standard Tesla Model 3.\\n\\n5. The valuation doesn\\'t make sense\\n\\nThe fifth reason to not buy Tesla stock (even with free capital) is its valuation. As I noted above, optimists love to value Tesla as more than a car company. But its operating results clearly show that its profitability is entirely dependent on selling EVs and, to a far lesser extent, on selling renewable energy credits and leasing its EVs.\\n\\nWith headwinds mounting for the auto industry and Tesla slashing the price of its flagship Model 3 and Model Y to avoid a buildup of inventory, Wall Street\\'s consensus earnings for the company in 2023 are falling big-time. The $5.80/share in full-year profit forecast three months ago for 2023 is now down to $4.23/share.\\n\\nEven with Tesla\\'s stock getting clobbered over the trailing 12 months, it\\'s still valued at an aggressive multiple of 34 times Wall Street\\'s consensus earnings. Not only do I believe this earnings-per-share estimate will continue to fall throughout the year, but I see no justification for Tesla to trade at a 34 multiple in a commoditized industry where high-single-digit price-to-earnings ratios are the norm.\\n\\n6. CEO Elon Musk is clearly distracted by side projects\\n\\nTo add to the list of reasons to avoid Tesla stock, CEO Elon Musk appears to be completely distracted by his side projects.\\n\\nAs many of you are probably aware, Musk closed on a $44 billion buyout of social media platform Twitter in late October. The Twitter buyout saga lasted for about half a year and has seemingly monopolized Musk\\'s attention since the deal closed. Even though Musk has stated that he plans to step down once a Twitter CEO successor is found, it\\'s perplexing that he doesn\\'t devote more attention to his $454 billion company that\\'s currently the leading EV producer in North America.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not all. In addition to his pet project Twitter, Musk is also the founder and CEO of SpaceX, the founder of The Boring Company, and the co-founder of Neuralink. If I were a Tesla investor, I\\'d be highly worried about my CEO\\'s commitment to growing the company and shareholder value.\\n\\n7. Elon Musk can\\'t be trusted\\n\\nBut if there\\'s one reason above all others why I\\'d never invest a penny in Tesla stock, it\\'s because I don\\'t trust Elon Musk. Although Musk is an innovator, his antics as CEO can\\'t be overlooked.\\n\\nMusk has, on multiple occasions, drawn the ire of securities regulators. In fact, he\\'s currently defending himself in court against a class action lawsuit regarding allegations that he misled Tesla\\'s shareholders when he tweeted in August 2018 that he had \"funding secured\" to take his company private.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s the ever-growing mountain of unfulfilled promises that\\'s arguably even more egregious. Musk has claimed that level 5 full self-driving technology has been about \"one year away\" since 2014. He also proclaimed that 1 million robotaxis would be on the roads by 2020, yet not a single robotaxi is on the road today. And his forecast for when innovations or EVs will hit showrooms has consistently been wrong -- e.g., the Cybertruck and Semi were delayed by years.\\n\\nTesla\\'s valuation is built on these promises of innovation, yet Musk has failed to deliver over and over again. That\\'s more-than-enough evidence for me to avoid putting any money to work in Tesla.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 30, 7, 0): [\"What happened\\n\\nElon Musk is making his first visit to China in three years, and investors like the implications of that. Shares of Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) jumped higher by as much as 6% on that and other news to start the trading week. As of 10:35 a.m. ET today, the stock was still higher by 4.3%.\\n\\nTesla stock has had a good month, up almost 25% in May.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nInvestors likely think Musk's visit signals a renewed focus on Tesla -- and China in particular -- after he hired a new CEO to run Twitter. He met with China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, and is expected to tour the company's Shanghai manufacturing plant.\\n\\nTesla shares are also benefiting from investor excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) after the widely followed investor Cathie Wood said on Twitter that the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer is the best way for investors to play the boom in the use of AI.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nTesla's largest plant is in Shanghai and can produce about 1 million vehicles annually. The company has also announced plans to build a battery factory there. While the details of Musk's meeting with the foreign minister weren't released, it's possible that the company also plans on adding capacity in the country.\\n\\nTesla has been battling rising competition in China by cutting vehicle prices, but Musk has said there is more to that strategy than just fighting near-term competition. He believes that his company will see rising future profits from software-like margins when it releases autonomous driving capability and other upgrades to customers. That's why he wants to focus on volume, rather than profits, at this time.\\n\\nThat is one obvious area for Tesla to profit from AI. It uses AI for its models to train software to drive vehicles. The company is trying to perfect its full self-driving technology and build vehicles for driverless taxi service. But Wood also thinks that AI being used for Tesla's humanoid robot project called Optimus could bring huge future profits for Tesla.\\n\\nShareholders have seen the stock rise recently from ongoing AI hype and its potential. Today the stock got an extra boost as Musk renews his personal relations with leaders in China. Investors hope this is a sign that there will be more gains to be had in that large EV market.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 1, 7, 0): [\"Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) is one of the leading players in the electric vehicle (EV) market, and it's making big bets on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

If the company can perfect its AI-powered autonomous driving technologies, it will have the chance to launch massive new businesses including robotaxis and self-driving trucks for commercial goods transport.\\n\\nBut Tesla isn't the only top automaker that's making big bets in the self-driving space, and some reports suggest another leading EV company is actually ahead in the category. If you're looking for EV stocks that have the potential to benefit from the AI revolution, read on to see why this company could be a worthwhile investment.\\n\\nThis auto giant is gearing up for a self-driving future\\n\\nGeneral Motors' (GM -1.59%) Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system has been serving up encouraging results and outperforming Tesla's full self-driving system according to some trials. According to a test of GM, Tesla, and Ford Motor Company's respective autonomous-driving systems conducted by CNBC's Michael Wayland late last year, GM's Super Cruise was the best-performing and most consistent of the three.\\n\\nSuper Cruise has broadly received very strong marks for its highway driving capabilities, and the automaker says that it will have the Super Cruise tech available in 22 vehicles by the end of this year, including the Bolt EUV, Blazer EV, Equinox EV, and the Silverado EV. GM is also gearing up to launch the next evolution of the tech.\\n\\nThe company's Ultra Cruise feature will debut with next year's Cadillac Celestiq model and is said to be able to handle 95% of all roads and driving situations. With updates, the auto giant expects that Ultra Cruise will eventually be able to handle every paved road. Ultra Cruise is built around a sensor setup that's significantly more comprehensive than what's offered by current Tesla models and what's expected with the EV leader's next-generation updates.\\n\\nIn addition to its driver-assistance systems, GM also owns Cruise, a stand-alone business devoted to developing autonomous vehicle technologies. Cruise is focused on robotaxis and is already providing service in San Francisco, Austin, and Phoenix, and it expects to reach over $1 billion in annual revenue in 2025. Strikingly, the robotaxi unit believes that it will be do $50 billion in annual sales in 2030. Whether or not it manages to reach that ambitious target, Cruise has the potential to be a significant performance driver for GM.\\n\\nIs GM the better AI-driven EV stock?\\n\\nWhile Tesla trades at a whopping 55 times this year's expected earnings, GM is valued at just 5 times this year's expected profits. Of course, that's not to say that the current EV leader doesn't deserve a significant valuation premium.\\n\\nOver the trailing 12 months, GM has recorded revenue of roughly $161 billion. Meanwhile, Tesla has posted sales of $86 billion across the stretch. Yet despite the gulf in sales, the companies are much closer when it comes to actual profits generated across the stretch. GM has generated roughly $11.8 billion in net income over the trailing-12-month period, while Tesla generated approximately $9.4 billion in profits in the period.\\n\\nEven with headwinds tamping down on demand for its vehicles and the company implementing price cuts, Tesla is managing to deliver sales growth and margins that are the envy of the broader market. Posting superior margins and torrid revenue increases also means that the company is growing its earnings at a much faster rate compared other large automakers, but the market may be underestimating General Motors.\\n\\nWhile Tesla is still the clear leader in EVs, GM is now second in terms of unit sales in the U.S. market. It's unlikely that GM will ever be able to match Tesla when it comes to margins on vehicle sales, but AI-driven advances in self-driving tech could help GM gain market share, tap into the potentially massive robotaxi opportunity, and become significantly more profitable.\\n\\nAs of this writing, Tesla is valued at about $612 billion, while GM has a market cap of approximately $46 billion.

Nvidia\\n\\nSemiconductor company Nvidia stumbled last year as high inflation reduced demand for its gaming and data center chips. Revenue remained flat at $27 billion and free cash flow fell 53% to $3.8 billion. Unfortunately, management expects current quarter revenue to decline 22% as economic headwinds continue to suppress demand, though guidance implies operating expenses will also fall sharply.\\n\\nHowever, Nvidia should find it easy to reaccelerate growth when economic conditions improve. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for rendering realistic visual effects in video games and films, and for accelerating complex data center workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, Nvidia GPUs hold more than 90% market share in workstation graphics and supercomputer accelerators.\\n\\nThe company has recently branched into cloud software and services. Omniverse Cloud is a 3D design platform for metaverse applications. DGX Cloud provides on-demand access to Nvidia AI infrastructure, and it includes frameworks that accelerate AI application development in areas like retail, logistics, and healthcare. Nvidia also provides generative AI services for text, images, and video. For instance, investment company Morningstar uses the Nvidia NeMo model to scan and summarize financial documents.\\n\\nThose cloud services build on the brand authority Nvidia has cultivated as a chipmaker, and they create new revenue streams that offer more regular cash flow and higher margins than the sale of cyclical hardware products. Management values its addressable market at $1 trillion, and Nvidia should benefit greatly as technologies like the metaverse and AI continue to evolve.\\n\\nCurrently, shares trade at 24.4 times sales, above the three-year average of 20.7 times sales. That valuation is far from cheap, but Nvidia is the heart of the burgeoning AI industry, so investors should still consider buying a small position in this growth stock today.\\n\\n2. Tesla\\n\\nTesla faced an onslaught of headwinds last year. Supply chain problems and factory closures hindered production, while high inflation and rising interest rates hammered sales across the auto industry. Tesla managed to grow deliveries 40% to 1.3 million vehicles, but that figure fell short of its medium-term guidance calling for 50% annual growth. Fourth-quarter deliveries also fell short of the Wall Street consensus by a wide margin.\\n\\nSome analysts have explained that shortfall as a demand problem, but management brushed those concerns aside during the latest earnings call. CEO Elon Musk said the company was receiving orders at nearly twice the rate of production. Better yet, despite encountering a number of roadblocks throughout the year, Tesla reported impressive financial results. Revenue increased 51% to $81.5 billion, and GAAP net income soared 122% to $3.62 per diluted share. Tesla also led the industry with 18.2% market share in battery electric vehicles.\\n\\nAdditionally, the company achieved an operating margin of 16.8% last year, the highest among any volume carmaker. Musk attributes that accomplishment to manufacturing prowess, noting that Tesla has the most advanced manufacturing technology on the planet. Better yet, there are several reasons to believe the company will become more profitable in the future.\\n\\nTesla should see its logistics costs fall as production ramps at Gigafactory Berlin, its first European factory, simply because the company can now produce cars locally in that market. Tesla is also scaling production of its 4680 battery cell, a technology that promises to reinforce its cost leadership in battery pack production. The company can already produce battery packs (the most expensive part of an electric car) at a lower cost per kilowatt-hour than any other carmaker, but management says the 4680 cell will eventually cut costs by 56%.\\n\\nFinally, Tesla sees significant margin upside from its full self-driving (FSD) software. A beta version of the product was released to customers in North America last year, and Tesla plans to take the next step toward autonomous ride hailing by mass-producing a robotaxi next year. Ultimately, management believes FSD technology will be the company's most important source of profitability.\\n\\nTesla sits in front of a sizable market opportunity. Global electric car sales are expected to grow at 23% annually to hit $1.1 trillion by 2030, according to Precedence Research. And the autonomous vehicles market is expected to grow at 40% annually to reach $2.1 trillion by 2030, according to Research and Markets. As the current leader in battery electric vehicles and one of the leading AI companies (according to Musk), Tesla is set to benefit from both tailwinds. The stock currently trades at 8 times sales, a very rich valuation for a carmaker.\\n\\nInvestors must decide whether Tesla is a carmaker that dabbles in AI, or an AI company that makes cars. Those who find the second description more accurate should consider buying a few shares of this growth stock today. If Tesla does indeed disrupt the mobility industry with robotaxis, its revenue (and margins) could grow quickly and the current valuation multiple could fall in a hurry.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 8, 7, 0): [\"Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) has been selling electric vehicles (EVs) at scale for more than a decade, and it has since been the industry leader by a wide margin. In 2014, the company revealed plans to introduce driver assistance software that would eventually be capable of piloting each Tesla vehicle without human input.\\n\\nToday, that technology is known as full self-driving (or autonomous driving), and it's currently available in beta mode for some Tesla customers.\\n\\nMissed timelines aside, CEO Elon Musk has spoken about the enormous opportunities self-driving will create for Tesla and its customers. But in a June 6 Twitter post, he said he'd also be willing to license the software to other car makers. It's a move that could rake in billions of dollars at a very high profit margin, so let's explore the details.\\n\\nFull self-driving might be around the corner\\n\\nAccording to Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management, Tesla currently has 2.7 million vehicles on the road testing the beta version of its full self-driving software. In the first quarter of 2023, those customers reached an important milestone: The number of total miles they've driven using the autonomous technology crossed 150 million. It means Tesla has more data than any of its competitors, and data is king for any software that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and improve.\\n\\nMusk has a grand vision for the way full self-driving will work in the real world. In his eyes, it isn't a novelty that customers will use to get from point-to-point more conveniently, but rather it will transform mobility in general.\\n\\nIn a sit-down interview with CNBC's David Faber following Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in May, he said the average passenger vehicle was only used for an average of 10 to 12 hours per week, spending the majority of its time parked at the owner's home or workplace. By installing self-driving software, that idle time can be spent on the road serving in a ride-hailing network, earning money for both the owner and for Tesla.\\n\\nIn that same interview, Musk said he believed the company's full self-driving software could be publicly released later this year.\\n\\nFull self-driving is a substantial financial opportunity\\n\\nTesla has the highest gross profit margin of all car manufacturers. It came in at 19.3% in Q1, and that was after the company slashed the price of its vehicles to drive demand in this weak economic environment.\\n\\nBut self-driving software is a game-changer because it can be developed once and sold an infinite number of times. The typical software company operates at a gross profit margin of 70% (or more), and Musk said Tesla could theoretically sell its vehicles at cost price and rely on customers installing its autonomous technology as its main source of profit.\\n\\nOperating an autonomous ride-hailing network would take that a step further. Musk says Tesla could split ride-sharing revenue with its customers 50/50 or 70/30, which means it will earn money from each vehicle sold for as long as it's on the road! But how much revenue might be on the table? Ark Investment Management thinks autonomous ride-sharing platforms could generate as much as $4 trillion by 2027, which could make this Tesla's largest opportunity ever.\\n\\nHere's how much licensing autonomous software could be worth to Tesla\\n\\nWithout knowing the precise economics, like what Tesla would charge other car makers for its full self-driving software, or what they'd be willing to pay, it's hard to know how big this opportunity could be. However, there's already one company setting some benchmarks: Nvidia (NVDA -3.48%).\\n\\nNvidia is one of the world's best semiconductor producers, and it's also the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence technologies right now. It also has a booming automotive segment which often gets overlooked by investors because it's only generating a small amount of revenue at the moment. However, its Drive platform is a complete hardware and software solution for any automotive manufacturer looking to install self-driving capabilities into its new cars.\\n\\nSo far, Nvidia has signed up dozens of leading car brands, with Mercedes Benz set to launch a new car with the platform installed in 2024. To date, those customers have signed $14 billion worth of deals with Nvidia which will convert to revenue between now and 2028.\\n\\nThat's a great sign for Tesla because it proves there is clear demand from third parties, and they have an appetite to invest billions of dollars in self-driving software. But will Tesla actually pursue this opportunity? Elon Musk's Twitter post aside, the company just agreed to grant Ford's (F -1.65%) EV customers access to its charging network nationwide, so it's certainly taking a more open approach to its technology.\\n\\nIn the end, more revenue opportunities will almost always spell good news for investors.\",\n  'By\\n\\nTesla has told suppliers to prepare for Cybertruck production by stating it plans to build 375,000 units of the all-electric pickup every year, according to a new report.\\n\\nThe Tesla Cybertruck was unveiled in November 2019 and has been delayed on several occasions, but the automaker has finally started making significant strides toward initial production. The first lines have already been built at Tesla Gigafactory Texas, which the company showed during its Q1 Earnings Call earlier this year.\\n\\nHowever, the truck has amassed a significant number of pre-orders: nearly 1.5 million, according to a reservation tracker. With production nearing, Tesla has finally started communicating to suppliers regarding its plans for annual output, according to a report from Electrek.\\n\\nTesla has evidently called the Cybertruck program “Project Everest” and is already asking suppliers to meet a base production volume of 375,000 Cybertruck units per year, according to the report.\\n\\nThis is a significant figure for initial production, especially considering CEO Elon Musk has stated in the past on several occasions that the Cybertruck has been one of the most difficult vehicles to figure out in terms of engineering and design.\\n\\nTesla is set to have initial release candidates for the Cybertruck ready by August, the report also states. Tesla has not officially released any details regarding the pickup’s first deliveries, only saying that the pricing and other important details would be stated at a delivery event sometime in the third quarter.\\n\\nTesla has brought forth new designs for the Cybertruck from its initial production prototypes that were unveiled in 2019 or later. The most recent Cybertrucks, which were seen at Investor Day earlier this year, were equipped with a variety of new features, including a new yoke steering wheel design.\\n\\nTesla has also finalized the design for the Cybertruck, which gives even more indication that production is likely going to start soon.

One obvious trend involves electric vehicles (EVs) and it began largely on interest in Tesla (TSLA -3.13%). A more recent trend is deciding which of the start-up EV companies can grow into a true Tesla rival.\\n\\nWhile the interest does go to the potential performance of each company, most investors are admittedly more focused on the stock performance of these EV makers. As EV companies go, Rivian (RIVN -4.99%) often gets mentioned as a potential manufacturer who could eventually compete with Tesla.\\n\\nAs for stock performance, does Rivian have a chance to come close to matching Tesla's 122% year-to-date rally?\\n\\nRivian's rally is underway\\n\\nRivian got a late start on its 2023 rally -- but that only makes its short-term potential all the more intriguing. Its stock is now up 40% year to date (with all the gains coming in the past month), but that still leaves plenty of space between it and Tesla's 122% rally. What's driving the current spike, and what could help it close the gap further?\\n\\nUntil Rivian's recent rally, the stock generally underperformed, going all the way back to shortly after its initial public offering in November 2021. Much of that poor performance was related to investor concerns that demand for the company's vehicles was waning. There were also supply chain issues related to its R1T pickup and its quad-motor design that required separate electric motors for each wheel. That created a bottleneck for production and deliveries.\\n\\nManagement eventually addressed the problem by switching to its internally developed Enduro drive unit. That should help resolve the supply chain issue and also reduce costs. It also began offering a somewhat less powerful dual-motor version of the R1T.\\n\\nSo far, the results have been positive. In the second quarter, Rivian produced 13,992 vehicles and delivered 12,640, compared to the first quarter's 9,395 and 7,946, respectively. Further, its second-quarter deliveries easily topped the estimates of 11,000 units.\\n\\nOther factors could add fuel to Rivian's rally\\n\\nMany things could add fuel to Rivian's rally, but here are a few worth noting.\\n\\nTopping its forecast pace of 50,000 vehicles produced in 2023 will excite investors. Management maintains that the company is on track to meet its manufacturing guidance. A slow first-quarter start means that through the first half, it produced just 23,387 vehicles. To surpass 50,000 vehicles in 2023, Rivian will need to turn out at least 14,113 vehicles each quarter.\\n\\nManagement's 50,000 guidance was disappointing to some investors because it fell short of Wall Street analysts' estimates for 60,000 to 65,000 units. But Rivian management has reportedly told employees internally that the company could still produce 62,000 vehicles in 2023. A result like that could give a huge boost to its stock price rally.\\n\\nAnother way for Rivian to fuel its rally would be to expand its lead on Ford Motor Company's F-150 Lightning electric pickup. Detroit automakers are known for their hugely popular and hugely profitable trucks, and although the F-150 Lightning is still fairly new to the market, it's easy to believe that Detroit's pickup truck dominance will eventually expand to include electric models. That said, during the first half of 2023, nearly 16,500 Rivian R1Ts were sold, while Ford sold only 8,757 F-150 Lightnings.\\n\\nWith the ramp-up in production, Rivian continues to report heavy losses and added cash burn in the medium term. But other financial metrics in its second- and third-quarter reports could provide positive surprises (Rivian will report Q2 results on Aug. 8).\\n\\nOne metric investors are keyed in on is gross profit. That metric was actually a loss of $535 million during the first quarter of 2023, worse than the prior-year period's $502 million loss. However, management said it expects the EV maker to be gross profit positive in 2024. If the company accelerates toward that target at a faster rate than expected -- perhaps thanks to its recent move to use Enduro motors in the R1T -- it would certainly help drive the stock's rally.\\n\\nThe bottom line on Rivian\\n\\nUltimately, a lot of what Rivian needs to do from here to drive a rally that could catch up to Tesla's 2023 performance is exactly what it has been doing: accelerate production and deliveries faster than expected. If the gap between deliveries and production closes as it did during the second quarter, hinting toward strong demand, even better.\\n\\nBut the other catalysts discussed above could certainly boost the rally even further. Will they happen? Time will tell. Will they exceed Tesla's stock rally? Savvy investors should stay tuned.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 14, 7, 0): ['Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) defied the odds and upended the auto sector, effectively proving that electric vehicles (EVs) were a viable product. Today, every major car company is working on EVs. But there are also a lot of upstart EV makers that want to follow in Tesla\\'s tire tracks.\\n\\nOne of those startups is Canoo (GOEV -0.52%). How likely is this EV maker to succeed? The odds are against it and there are at least three reasons it probably won\\'t.\\n\\n1. Canoo lacks the products needed to really compete\\n\\nAt this point, Tesla has a whole lineup of autos to sell, from an SUV to a sedan, with a pickup truck in the works. It produced 440,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023, with deliveries of 422,000. While not exactly the largest automaker on the planet, it is clearly well-established.\\n\\nCanoo is hoping to produce 20,000 cars in all of 2023, with the goal of doubling that in 2024. But even if it does hit these production targets, it will still be just a fraction of the size of Tesla.\\n\\nMeanwhile, it not only has to compete with Tesla, but also all of the other major automakers that are quickly ramping up their EV capacity. The EV niche is far more crowded than it was when Tesla started out, and that makes standing out today far more difficult.\\n\\n2. Canoo is bleeding red ink\\n\\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Tesla produced revenue of $23.3 billion, up from $18.8 billion in the same quarter of the prior year (auto sales make up around 85% of the top line). Earnings per share came in at $0.73, down from $0.95, at least partly due to swiftly rising costs. But after a long period of red ink as it built its business up, Tesla is a very profitable company today.\\n\\nCanoo\\'s first quarter produced another gusher of red ink. It listed no revenue (zero!) and posted a per-share loss of $0.22.\\n\\nThere are some caveats. For example, the California-based company is basically still building its EV business, and you have to spend money to do that before you can start selling products to produce revenue. That is exactly what Tesla did, so the loss isn\\'t exactly unexpected.\\n\\nThe loss was also down from a per-share loss of $0.54 in the first quarter of 2022. So in some respects, things are getting better. But the company still has a long way to go before it is sustainably profitable.\\n\\n3. Canoo is running up against some deadlines\\n\\nAt this point, Tesla doesn\\'t have nearly as much to prove as it did when it was a start-up like Canoo. In fact, as long as the company doesn\\'t make a huge misstep, it looks like it is here to stay, with ample access to the capital markets to support long-term growth. The same thing can\\'t be said of Canoo.\\n\\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2023, Canoo had $6.7 million in cash, down from $36.5 million in the year-ago period. That\\'s a very material drop for a company that still has to spend huge sums of cash to build out its business.\\n\\nThat fact is highlighted in the company\\'s 10-Q, in which it stated: \"Our management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding or do not have access to additional capital, we will be unable to execute our business plans and could be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations.\"\\n\\nCanoo could come up with the money it needs, but with the stock down more than 95% from its 2021 highs, selling more stock isn\\'t an investor-friendly option. And with so little cash and the ongoing red ink, debt markets might not be too friendly, either.\\n\\nThe company is likely to have to pay dearly for any additional funding at this point, which will limit its earnings and growth potential. If it doesn\\'t find that funding, meanwhile, there\\'s a very real chance that Canoo will go out of business.\\n\\nCanoo faces an uphill climb\\n\\nInvestors could argue that Canoo\\'s vehicles are so wonderful that the company will be successful. Unfortunately, having a superior product doesn\\'t guarantee success. (Betamax lost out to VHS, to cite a famous example.)\\n\\nAnd even if the EV maker does get its production up and running as it hopes, it still has to compete within a very crowded EV field. Canoo putting a going-concern statement into its Securities and Exchange Commission filing is a very worrying sign that investors should not take likely.\\n\\nAt this point, it looks like Canoo will be lucky to survive, let alone take on an EV giant like Tesla. Only the most aggressive investors should even consider the stock, and even they should tread with extreme caution.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 31, 7, 0): ['One of the reasons Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) has been a trendy stock pick is its tendency to break all of the rules established by traditional automakers. Whether by solely offering electric vehicles (EVs), forsaking the dealer network model, using a non-union workforce, or not advertising, Tesla has disrupted the auto industry.\\n\\nHowever, Tesla is about to back away from one item it has consistently not done: advertise its products. So how will this affect Tesla, and should investors be worried? Let\\'s find out.\\n\\nTesla has a basic message to get out\\n\\nCEO Elon Musk said at Tesla\\'s annual shareholder meeting: \"We\\'ll try a little advertising and see how it goes.\" As investors, this could be seen as a huge red flag or a kind of small green flag.\\n\\nOn the red flag side, if Tesla needs to advertise, it clearly indicates falling demand for its product. With Tesla\\'s premium valuation, the stock can\\'t afford having the business\\'s growth slow down, and this strategic shift may be writing on the wall for Tesla.\\n\\nHowever, part of the reason for this advertising campaign is to get the word out that Tesla\\'s models aren\\'t as expensive as one might think. During the meeting, it was brought up that the average starting price of Tesla\\'s models is less than the average car price in the U.S. If a small ad campaign can shed light on this fact and change consumer sentiment, this could create even more demand for Tesla and provide the growth the company is looking for.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear how much Tesla will spend on advertising, but looking at competitors\\' budgets may be a good place to start.\\n\\nTesla may be giving up some of its margin advantages\\n\\nFord has a massive ad budget, spending $2.2 billion in 2022 and $3.1 billion in 2021. After subtracting the cost of revenue, Ford\\'s gross margins were $14.4 billion in 2022. That means Ford\\'s advertising budget eats up about 15% of its gross profit.\\n\\nShifting back to Tesla in 2022: It made a gross profit of $20.9 billion. It\\'s worth noting that Tesla produced a significantly higher gross profit than Ford despite having only 52% of the revenue.\\n\\nIf Tesla decided to spend 15% of its gross profit on advertising, it could drop $3.1 billion on this line item. Now I think that\\'s highly unlikely, as Musk indicated they would only \"try a little.\" Still, advertising can eat through money quickly.\\n\\nInvestors might see the effects of advertising soon through personal experience or in second-quarter results, but how it will work out for Tesla is unknown. It all boils down to the motive behind advertising: Is it education or a last-ditch effort to create some demand for its cars?\\n\\nWith Tesla\\'s current stock valuation, the bulls are still winning this argument, so the positivity hasn\\'t left yet. However, should Tesla experience falling sales even with advertising, some investors may exit the stock for fear of Tesla reverting to a usual automaker\\'s habits.\\n\\nPersonally, I\\'m in the camp that a bit of advertising will likely help Tesla. Musk is pretty intelligent about the workings of a business and has led Tesla well so far. I think the news of Tesla starting to advertise is more noise than signal, but investors will be able to know for sure by examining the future quarterly results.'],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 9, 7, 0): ['What happened\\n\\nShares of Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) jumped on Friday, rising about 5.8% by 9:50 a.m. ET.

But the question remains whether or not the company can maintain its rally amid fears of margin pressure and increased competition. Let's explore why these near-term challenges could be long-term opportunities.\\n\\n1. Tesla's margins remain fantastic\\n\\nOne of the things that set Tesla apart from most other automakers is its margins, which tend to be high for the industry. In 2022, the company generated total revenue of $81.5 billion compared to an operating income of $13.7 billion, a margin of 16.8%. For comparison, Tesla's large (majority gasoline-powered) U.S. rivals like Ford and General Motors generally have margins in the single digits.\\n\\nThere are several explanations for Tesla's incredible profitability. For starters, the company's recognizable brand means it doesn't have to spend money on advertising and promotion. Management has also worked to unlock manufacturing efficiencies and vertical integration -- expanding its battery manufacturing capacity and bypassing dealership networks by selling cars directly to customers. All this means better margins and bigger profits for the company.\\n\\n2. Price war fears are overblown\\n\\nSome Wall Street analysts fear that Tesla could eventually lose its margin advantage because of a recent spate of price cuts. While the company actually raised U.S. prices (by a measly $250) in May, this follows price reductions of around 20% globally by the start of the year. That said, investors should focus on the big picture.\\n\\nElectric vehicles (EVs) represented just 10% of new car sales in 2022. And Goldman Sachs estimates that this number will soar to 61% by 2040. With the industry still at a nascent stage, it makes sense for Tesla to focus on maximizing its long-term market share instead of profit.\\n\\nThe company does face significant competition from unprofitable rivals, such as Lucid and Rivian Automotive. But by keeping prices low, it can effectively prevent these companies from becoming a future threat to its business.\\n\\nFurther, Tesla's price cuts may not have as much of a negative impact on margins as investors expect. In its investor day presentation, the company highlighted a plan to slash the prices of its next generation of vehicles by 50% -- a move that could support further price reductions while maintaining an industry-leading level of profitability.\\n\\nWhat is next for Tesla?\\n\\nTesla investors should remember that, despite its luxury-adjacent brand, the company aims to become a mass-market automaker. Much of its operational cost savings will likely be passed on to consumers to maximize market share, leading to better economies of scale and more cost savings in the future. This strategy could reward investors much more than a low-volume, higher-margin model.\\n\\nWith a price-to-earnings multiple of 42, Tesla's stock trades at a premium valuation compared to the S&P 500 average of 24. But this looks justified when considering that the EV market is still in its early stages, and Tesla has all the tools it needs to dominate the opportunity.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 8, 8, 0): [\"What happened\\n\\nTesla (TSLA -3.13%) stock gained 40.6% in January, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The electric vehicle company's share price gained ground in conjunction with positive momentum for the broader market, better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, and other developments that the market interpreted as bullish indicators for future performance.\\n\\nJanuary was a huge month for Tesla stock. The biggest positive valuation catalyst valuation arrived with the company's Q4 results, which the company published on Jan. 25. The EV maker posted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $1.19 on revenue of $24.32 billion, while the average analyst estimate had called for per-share earnings of $1.13 on sales of $24.16 billion. The top-and-bottom-line beats gave the stock a fresh injection of positive momentum, but there were also other catalysts that shaped performance last month.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nTesla kicked off the new year with a huge announcement. The EV leader revealed on Jan. 13 that it would be cutting global prices on all of its car lines by as much as 20%. The news initially prompted sell-offs for the stock, as investors weighed the negative impacts that this would likely have on the company's margins. But the market warmed up to the decision as the prospects of increasing unit sales and putting pressure on competitors came more clearly into focus.\\n\\nThe company followed the news up with the publication of its fourth-quarter earnings release, and the report arrived with plenty for investors to celebrate. Earnings per share were up 40% year over year on a split-adjusted basis, and sales were up 37% compared to the prior-year period.\\n\\nThe fourth quarter saw the company produce 439,000 vehicles and deliver over 405,000. Tesla ended the year with 1.31 million vehicle deliveries and 1.37 million vehicles produced -- up 40% and 47% year over year, respectively.\\n\\nIn the company's Q4 conference call, CEO Elon Musk also expanded on guidance for 1.8 million vehicles produced in 2023 by saying that it's possible that the company will produce 2 million cars this year if there aren't any logistical or supply chain disruptions. The market responded very favorably to the results and guidance, and bullish momentum for Tesla stock has continued in February.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nTesla stock has continued to gain ground in February's trading. The company's share price is up roughly 15.4% in the month so far, as of this writing. But even after the recent rally, Tesla stock still trades down roughly 51% from its high.\\n\\nThe rising interest rate environment has been hard on valuations for many growth stocks, but it looks like pressures on that front are beginning to moderate. At its meeting on Feb. 1, the Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis-point interest rate hike -- a welcome reprieve following four 75-basis-point increases and a 50-basis-point increase that had previously been served up by the central-banking authority. The Fed expects to continue raising rates, but it looks like rate hikes are having the desired effect of tamping down inflation.\\n\\nIf macroeconomic conditions stabilize and Tesla continues serving up strong business results, the stock could continue to march higher in 2023.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 5, 7, 0): [\"Competitors rarely work together in the business world. However, it recently happened when electric vehicle (EV) titan Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) and legacy automaker Ford shocked Wall Street by announcing a partnership that would let Ford customers plug into Tesla's supercharger network.\\n\\nThe announcement came from a recent Twitter-spaces event that Ford CEO Jim Farley participated in with Musk to discuss the electric vehicle industry. The partnership should make Ford's customers happy, but Tesla's shareholders could be the winners.\\n\\nThe development could eventually create a profitable revenue stream that could pad Tesla's coffers. Here is what you need to know.\\n\\nIf you can't beat 'em...\\n\\nElectric vehicles aren't just a new technology for the vehicle; they also require charging stations, a massive effort to populate America with the infrastructure needed to support millions of EVs on the road. Charging a car isn't as simple as pulling up to a fuel pump because the vehicle's charging ports must be compatible with the attachments at the charging station.\\n\\nTesla created what it calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS), which it uses on all its vehicles and charging stations in the U.S. and Canada. Many of Tesla's competitors created a different design, the Combined Charging System (CCS), and deemed it the standard for the EV industry. But Tesla has sold more vehicles than competitors who are still ramping up production. So which design is the real standard?\\n\\nFord decided that it wanted to lean on Tesla's further-along charging network to improve life for its customers as it seeks to ramp up its EV sales. The partnership will include adapters to make Ford's current EVs compatible with Tesla's NACS ports instead of the CCS. This is a potentially pivotable moment for the EV industry since further adoption of NACS would play further into Tesla's hands as a market leader. More vehicles using the NACS design means more potential charging traffic for Tesla.\\n\\nWelcomed high-margin revenue\\n\\nPulling non-Tesla drivers through its charging network is an excellent opportunity to bring profitable revenue to Tesla. The company has already invested the capital in building its charging network (and will continue these investments), so incremental payments from non-Tesla vehicles should mostly fall straight to its bottom line.\\n\\nIt's not yet known what Ford owners will pay to use Tesla's network, but there are some clues. Tesla charges by kilowatt-hour, and non-Tesla users pay a premium compared to Tesla owners. Tesla offers a monthly subscription for $12.99 to reduce the kilowatt-hour rate to that of Tesla owners, which might indicate the ballpark that Ford users will end up paying.\\n\\nRight now, paid supercharging revenue is a tiny part of Tesla's business, lumped into services and others in its financials. That revenue bucket was just $1.8 billion of its total $23 billion in the first quarter. Investors shouldn't expect a short-term notable impact of deals like Ford's partnership, but that could change. EVs are still just 1.5% of the global fleet, and service revenue from sources like charging could grow into a meaningful category over the coming years.\\n\\nWhat should investors do today?\\n\\nYou could think of Tesla and Ford's partnership as a single move in a long chess game. The EV industry is still in its early innings, and the battle over industry standards and market share is still being waged. In the short term, Tesla remains a stock that investors should track closely.\\n\\nHowever, now might not be the best time to buy as the shares are up 66% since January. Tesla could be starting to feel the impact of a slowing economy. Analysts are lowering their expectations for earnings growth, and inventory is building up each quarter. Combine that with price cuts that lowered Tesla's operating profit margin by 779 basis points year over year in the first quarter, and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 58 might be too steep.\\n\\nWith a beta of 2, Tesla's stock is volatile enough that investors will likely see some buying opportunities emerge in the future. Consider waiting until then before pulling the trigger on the shares.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 26, 7, 0): [\"What happened\\n\\nShares of Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) fell on Monday, declining as much as 5.4% at the day's lows, before recovering to a 3.8% decline as of 2:40 p.m. ET.\\n\\nYes, the broader Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -1.76%) was down as well today, as traders appeared to rotate out of large-cap tech stocks that have already gained an impressive amount this year.\\n\\nTesla is certainly in that camp, having roughly doubled in 2023, even after today's decline. However, its decline on Monday was exacerbated by a downgrade from a major Wall Street firm.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nOn Sunday night, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney released a note to his clients downgrading his rating on Tesla from buy to neutral. Although curiously, Delaney also raised his price target from $185 to $248.\\n\\nIf that seems like the analyst is adjusting his target after a huge rally to reflect the current share price, that appears to be the case. Delaney didn't so much change his rather bullish outlook on Tesla as a business, but rather adjusted his rating based on the fact that shares appear to be pricing in a lot of good news already. Delaney said:\\n\\nWhile the primary reason for the change in our view is that we think the market is now giving the stock more credit for its longer-term opportunities, we are also cognizant of the difficult pricing environment for new vehicles that we think will continue to weigh on Tesla's automotive [adjusted] gross margin this year...\\n\\nGoldman's downgrade follows last week's downgrade of shares by Barclays, in which analyst Dan Levy also said he still believes in Tesla as a business over the long term, but also believes shares have run too far and too fast.\\n\\nThat enthusiasm has been based on the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance Tesla's full self-driving capabilities, as well as last fall's decision to open up of Tesla's Supercharger network to third parties, which could lead to incremental profits as EV adoption ramps up in the U.S. However, those are both longer-term stories unlikely to affect this year's earnings much.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nTesla remains a highly volatile and contentious stock, prone to big jumps higher and crashes lower. This is, of course, what inevitably happens with a popular growth tech stock, which is often priced extremely expensively, but which also offers potential for disruption and innovation.\\n\\nCurrently, Tesla trades at a lofty 73 times earnings and 50 times 2024 estimates, while most auto stocks trade at single-digit multiples.\\n\\nHowever, if you are invested in Tesla, you likely are in the stock for the long-term innovation story. Given that this analyst call appears to be driven by short-term price fluctuations and the outlook over the next 12 months, it probably shouldn't affect your take on the stock, whether you're a bear or a bull.\"],\n datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 17, 7, 0): ['No wonder Tesla (TSLA -3.13%) shares have rallied sharply this year. The company is giving investors many reasons to be upbeat. Not only did Tesla report a staggering second-quarter year-over-year growth rate for vehicle deliveries of 83%, but management has also been telling investors that it expects deliveries of its long-awaited Cybertruck to start this year. This momentum in vehicle deliveries and Tesla\\'s exciting product plans are key reasons for the stock\\'s more than doubling this year.\\n\\nNow Tesla is giving investors yet another reason to remain optimistic. The company is reportedly planning to open a high-volume production factory in India, according to The Times of India. Citing \"government sources,\" the news website said on Thursday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been having discussions with the Indian government about a proposal to build a factory there to support production of a new, lower-cost vehicle in the country. A new factory and a new, lower-cost product could be what Tesla needs to help the growth stock live up to its pricey valuation.\\n\\nAmbitious plans in India\\n\\nSpecifically, The Times of India said its source believes the company is looking to build a factory that can build around 500,000 units per year. The vehicle it plans to build, the sources say, would have a starting price of around $24,000 in India. This compares to a starting price for the Model 3 of about $40,000.\\n\\nThe lower price point would dramatically expand Tesla\\'s addressable market by making its vehicles more affordable for the masses.\\n\\nFor some context on how significantly the factory could increase sales once it is at full production, Tesla finished the first quarter with installed tooling for production capacity of up to 2 million units per year. This new factory, therefore, would add 25% more to Tesla\\'s annual production capacity.\\n\\nEven more, a vehicle at this price point could solicit demand far over 500,000 units per year. So, if things go well with the potential vehicle, Tesla could eventually expand production capacity at the factory in a different market based on what it learns in India from producing the new electric car.\\n\\nDon\\'t get too excited\\n\\nWhile it\\'s good to hear reports of another potential Tesla factory and a possible new car that is significantly cheaper, investors should keep in mind that the automaker\\'s stock already prices in rapid expansion in production capacity and delivery volume growth over the coming years.\\n\\nDriving home just how high investors\\' expectations are, Tesla stock trades at more than 80 times earnings as of this writing, even though earnings per share are expected to decline this year due to recent vehicle price reductions. A valuation like this suggests investors expect continued strong growth in delivery volume to help earnings growth eventually resume and to then grow at robust double-digit rates for years to come. Further, to live up to the stock\\'s high price tag, Tesla will need to pull this off even as competition intensifies; virtually every major auto manufacturer has ambitious plans to expand production of electric vehicles.']}"
